# CEDA Model Card — WF1.2 Horizon Reconfiguration Null Control

This model card documents an internal null-control construction designed to test whether
horizon-mediated accessibility reconfiguration alone can source inflation-like behavior
under conservation-honest assumptions.

## 0. Proposal Identification

- **Title:** WF1.2 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Control
- **Authors:** Internal (CEDA test construction)
- **Year / Venue:** 2026 / Internal diagnostic
- **Link:** N/A (constructed test case)

## 1. Claimed Mechanism (Concise)

Inflation-like accelerated expansion is claimed to emerge from a reconfiguration of dynamically
accessible degrees of freedom as the cosmological horizon evolves, without introducing new
dynamical fields or modifying fundamental equations of motion.

## 2. Degrees of Freedom (DOF)

### Explicit Dynamical DOF

- Standard relativistic quantum field modes propagating on an FRW background
- Metric degrees of freedom governed by classical GR

No additional scalar fields, clocks, or modified gravity terms are introduced.

### Effective / Collective DOF

- Coarse-grained energy density and pressure defined over the interior (horizon-limited) region
- Horizon-accessible mode count used to define an effective interior description

### Fixed / Constrained Quantities

- Fundamental field content
- Action and equations of motion
- Background spacetime symmetry assumptions (homogeneous, isotropic FRW)

---

## 3. System–Environment Partition

- **System:** Degrees of freedom dynamically accessible within the cosmological horizon
- **Environment:** Degrees of freedom beyond the horizon, treated as inaccessible and traced out
- **Boundary Definition:** Cosmological horizon (comoving / apparent, specified per construction)

The partition evolves in time as the horizon expands, changing which modes are counted as interior.

---

## 4. Conservation Accounting

- **Stress–Energy Tensor Used:** Standard effective stress–energy constructed from interior modes
- **Additional Terms:** None introduced at the action level
- **Conservation Enforcement:** Local conservation enforced at the level of the underlying fields

Effective interior stress–energy is redefined as the partition
