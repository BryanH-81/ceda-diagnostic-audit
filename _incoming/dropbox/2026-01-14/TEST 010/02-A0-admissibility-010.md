## **A0 — Admissibility Declaration (Test 010\)**

**Model:** Canonical Single-Field Slow-Roll Inflation (Textbook Reference Class)

---

### **A0.1 Framework Ontology**

* Continuum semiclassical effective field theory on curved spacetime

* Spacetime geometry treated as classical

* Matter sector treated as quantum fields with classical expectation values

* No discrete, holographic, or nonlocal ontology assumed

---

### **A0.2 Allowed Reformulations (Declared Equivalent)**

The following are declared to represent **the same physical model**:

* Field redefinitions of the scalar field ϕ\\phiϕ

* Frame transformations (Jordan ↔ Einstein), provided invertible

* Choice of time variable or scale-factor parametrization

* Gauge choices for perturbations

* Separation of background and perturbations at Hubble scale

**Equivalence criteria**

The following must remain invariant:

* Background expansion history H(a)H(a)H(a) within slow-roll regime

* Localization of negative pressure in scalar-field stress–energy

* Conservation of energy–momentum

* Counting of independent degrees of freedom

---

### **A0.3 Allowed Coarse-Grainings**

* Coarse-graining at or near the Hubble scale

* Tracing out sub-Hubble modes for background evolution

* EFT cutoff assumed fixed within validity regime

Coarse-graining is treated as **descriptive**, not dynamical.

---

### **A0.4 Physical Equivalence Standard**

Descriptions are physically equivalent if they yield:

* Identical background dynamics under slow-roll conditions

* Identical stress–energy sourcing of the metric

* Identical causal structure (no horizon agency)

---

### **A0.5 Symmetry Commitments**

* Diffeomorphism invariance

* Local Lorentz invariance

* No symmetry breaking beyond standard slow-roll assumptions

---

### **A0.6 Conservation Commitments**

* Covariant conservation of total stress–energy

* No phenomenological exchange terms

* No horizon-sourced energy

---

### **A0.7 Causal Structure**

* Local light-cone causality

* Horizons treated strictly as causal boundaries

* Horizons have no dynamical or energetic agency

---

### **A0.8 Well-Posed Evolution**

* Initial data: scalar field value and velocity within slow-roll regime

* Evolution governed by Einstein–Klein–Gordon equations

* Breakdown occurs when slow-roll conditions fail

---

### **A0.9 Explicit Non-Equivalences**

The following are **not** equivalent:

* Changing scalar potential functional form

* Introducing additional fields

* Modifying gravity sector

* Extending beyond slow-roll EFT control

* Treating horizons as physical agents

### **A0.10 Admissibility Acknowledgment**

CEDA will evaluate this model **only** within these declared boundaries.  
 Undeclared freedoms may not be invoked post-diagnostic.
