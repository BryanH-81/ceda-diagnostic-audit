### **Run Validity Gate — PRE-CHECK**

| Requirement | Status |
| ----- | ----- |
| RG1 Model Card complete | ☑ |
| RG2 Translation Card complete | ☑ |

### **Diagnostics Requested**

**D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null**  
 ☐ No  
 Justification: Model introduces explicit scalar dynamics; not horizon-only.

---

**D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability**  
 ☑ Yes  
 Admissible variations:

* Small changes in coarse-graining scale

* Equivalent frame descriptions

Failure criteria:

* Loss of inflationary behavior without retuning

* Order-unity change in w(a)w(a)w(a)

---

**D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance**  
 ☑ Yes  
 Key question:

* Are any effective energy transfers introduced implicitly?

---

**C1 — Coupling Provenance & Redundancy**  
 ☑ Yes  
 Target: Framework-level  
 Compression test:

* Does scalar potential reduce functional freedom relative to free w(t)w(t)w(t)?

---

**S1 — Scheme / State Dependence**  
 ☑ Yes  
 State-conditional: vacuum choice for perturbations  
 Scheme-fragile: none declared at background level

---

**D4 — Predictive Wedge**  
 ☑ Conditional  
 Trigger: Only within declared slow-roll regime

---

### **Conditional Verdict Symmetry**

Enabled: ☑ Yes  
 Rule: Inflation evaluated only within declared EFT control; no extrapolation credited.

---

### **Diagnostic Integrity Statement**

☑ No diagnostics have been run  
 ☑ No verdict language present

**Auditor Declaration:**  
 “This card fully declares the diagnostic protocol. No criteria will be added post hoc.”
