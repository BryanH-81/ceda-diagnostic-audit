### Canonical Single-Field Slow-Roll Inflation (Textbook Reference Class)

---

## **A. Identity**

**Model name**  
 Canonical single-field slow-roll inflation (textbook formulation)

**Primary reference**  
 Steven Weinberg, *Cosmology* (2008), Inflation chapters  
 (Representative reference class; not a single novelty paper)

**Category**  
 Inflation — scalar-field driven, semiclassical GR, EFT-controlled regime

**Intended target phenomena**  
 Homogeneity and isotropy  
 Flatness  
 Generation of nearly scale-invariant primordial perturbations

---

## **B. Claimed Mechanism (Concise)**

Accelerated expansion is driven by a minimally coupled scalar field whose potential energy dominates over its kinetic energy during a slow-roll phase, producing an effective equation of state close to vacuum ( w≃−1w \\simeq \-1w≃−1 ) for a finite interval.

---

## **C. Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Inventory**

**Dynamically active DOF**

* Spacetime metric gμνg\_{\\mu\\nu}gμν​

* Single scalar field ϕ\\phiϕ with canonical kinetic term

* Scalar potential V(ϕ)V(\\phi)V(ϕ)

**Inactive / integrated-out / environment DOF**

* Sub-Hubble quantum fluctuations beyond coarse-grained background

* Heavy fields assumed decoupled in EFT regime

* UV completion degrees of freedom (not specified)

**Effective or collective sectors**

* Homogeneous background scalar field

* Linearized perturbations treated separately

---

## **D. Causal Domain \+ Horizon**

**Interior domain**  
 Homogeneous FRW background spacetime with perturbative fluctuations

**Horizon definition**  
 Comoving Hubble radius (aH)−1(aH)^{-1}(aH)−1; particle horizon implicitly used in perturbation discussion

**Boundary dynamics**  
 Horizon scale evolves due to background expansion; horizon is treated as a causal boundary, not a dynamical agent

---

## **E. Coarse-Graining Prescription**

**Coarse-graining scale(s)**  
 Hubble-scale separation between background and perturbations

**Traced-out content**  
 Sub-Hubble modes in background evolution; UV physics above EFT cutoff

**Fixed vs variable**

* EFT cutoff assumed fixed within regime

* Slow-roll parameters assumed small and slowly varying

---

## **F. Effective Stress–Energy Construction**

**Metric sourcing**  
 Einstein equations sourced by scalar-field stress–energy tensor:

Tμν(ϕ)=∂μϕ∂νϕ−gμν\[12(∂ϕ)2+V(ϕ)\]T\_{\\mu\\nu}^{(\\phi)} \= \\partial\_\\mu \\phi \\partial\_\\nu \\phi \- g\_{\\mu\\nu}\\left\[\\tfrac12 (\\partial\\phi)^2 \+ V(\\phi)\\right\]Tμν(ϕ)​=∂μ​ϕ∂ν​ϕ−gμν​\[21​(∂ϕ)2+V(ϕ)\]

**Vacuum / potential terms**  
 Potential energy V(ϕ)V(\\phi)V(ϕ) provides dominant contribution during inflationary phase

---

## **G. Conservation and Exchange Accounting**

**Sector continuity**  
 Energy–momentum conservation enforced covariantly:

∇μTμν=0\\nabla\_\\mu T^{\\mu\\nu} \= 0∇μ​Tμν=0

**Exchange terms**  
 None introduced. No phenomenological energy exchange between sectors during inflationary phase.

---

## **H. Acceleration Source Location**

Negative pressure arises **intrinsically** from scalar-field dynamics, specifically dominance of potential energy over kinetic energy in Tμν(ϕ)T\_{\\mu\\nu}^{(\\phi)}Tμν(ϕ)​.

No horizon-sourced or bookkeeping-dependent pressure terms are invoked.

---

## **I. Stability Hooks (for D2)**

**Admissible variations**

* Small shifts in coarse-graining scale around Hubble radius

* Equivalent frame descriptions (Jordan ↔ Einstein where applicable)

* Modest changes in initial conditions consistent with slow-roll regime

**Observables required to remain stable**

* Background equation of state w(a)w(a)w(a)

* Slow-roll parameters ϵ,η\\epsilon, \\etaϵ,η

* Background expansion rate H(a)H(a)H(a)

---

## **J. Declared Predictive Wedge**

**Operational difference from ΛCDM without inflation**

* Dynamical origin of early accelerated expansion

* Predicts nearly scale-invariant scalar perturbations with calculable deviations

**Falsifiability (within declared regime)**

* Breakdown of slow-roll conditions

* Failure of scalar dynamics to sustain w≃−1w \\simeq \-1w≃−1

* Incompatibility with perturbation spectra under EFT control

---

### **Notes on Scope**

* Reheating mechanism not audited

* UV completion not claimed

* Eternal inflation not included

* Validity strictly limited to semiclassical EFT slow-roll regime
