## **CEDA TRANSLATION CARD — Test 010**

**Audit ID:** CEDA-010  
 **Model:** Canonical Single-Field Slow-Roll Inflation  
 **Source:** Weinberg (2008), *Cosmology* (textbook reference class)

### **T1. Native Description Summary**

Inflation is described as a phase of accelerated expansion driven by a scalar field whose potential energy dominates its kinetic energy, producing a near–de Sitter background for a finite interval.

### **T2. Degrees of Freedom Mapping**

| Native DOF | CEDA Classification | Dynamically Accessible | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Metric gμνg\_{\\mu\\nu}gμν​ | Dynamical | Yes | Classical GR |
| Scalar field ϕ\\phiϕ | Dynamical | Yes | Canonical kinetic term |
| Heavy fields | Environment | No | Assumed decoupled |
| UV physics | Environment | No | Outside EFT regime |

### **T3. System–Environment Partition**

* **Interior:** FRW background \+ scalar field

* **Environment:** Sub-Hubble modes, UV degrees of freedom

* **Partition basis:** EFT \+ Hubble-scale separation

Partition evolves as the Hubble scale changes.

---

### **T4. Horizon / Boundary Interpretation**

* Horizon type: Hubble radius / particle horizon

* Role assigned: causal boundary only

* Time dependence: implicit via expansion

* No horizon agency asserted

---

### **T5. Coarse-Graining Interpretation**

* Scale: Hubble scale

* Traced out: short-wavelength modes

* Held fixed: EFT cutoff, scalar potential form

* Coarse-graining explicitly descriptive

---

### **T6. Exchange-Term Mapping**

* Exchange terms present: **No**

* Stress–energy derived directly from scalar-field action

* No phenomenological closure terms introduced

---

### **T7. Translation Confidence**

☑ **High** — textbook formulation admits little ambiguity at background level
