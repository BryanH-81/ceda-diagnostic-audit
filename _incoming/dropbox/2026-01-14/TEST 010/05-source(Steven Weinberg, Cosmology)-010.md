# **SOURCE DOCUMENT (TEXTBOOK)**

**Authoritative reference class**

**Cosmology**  
 Steven Weinberg, *Cosmology*, Cambridge University Press (2008)  
 Primary inflation material: Chapters on inflation and primordial perturbations.

### **Important (non-negotiable)**

You **cannot** upload the textbook itself (copyright)

CEDA does **not** require full text ingestion.  
 It requires **explicit reference anchoring**, which this satisfies.

In all three documents, use language like:

“Representative reference class: Weinberg (2008), *Cosmology*, inflation chapters. No novelty claims audited.”
