| ID | Translation Element | Competing Interpretations | Physically Admissible? | Affects Diagnostics? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| AB1 | C(t) function | (A) Physical field (B) Computational seed (C) Effective description | Unclear \- no action principle | **Yes** \- determines if D1 applies |
| AB2 | Γ threshold | (A) Physical coupling (B) Free parameter (C) Emergent from dynamics | Not derivable from first principles | **Yes** \- C1 outcome depends on this |
| AB3 | "Rendering" | (A) Literal computational process (B) Metaphor for observation (C) Emergent classicalization | No substrate specified | **Yes** \- fundamental to entire model |
| AB4 | Dark Matter | (A) Non-rendered regions (B) Computational latency (C) Unobserved geometric potential | Not testable | **Yes** \- violates D1 if treated as mechanism |
| AB5 | Expansion | (A) Increasing mesh resolution (B) Physical negative pressure (C) Artifact of perspective | Author claims (A), but this is not a physical mechanism | **Critical** \- determines entire verdict |

**Branching Rule Trigger:** AB3 and AB5 are **not resolvable** from paper content and fundamentally change model interpretation.

**CEDA Decision:** Branching **not applicable** \- ambiguities stem from **insufficient specification**, not legitimate alternative physical interpretations.

**Consequence:** Model fails Run Validity Gate before branching would apply.

# **RUN VALIDITY GATE ASSESSMENT — CED-011**

## **RG1 — Model Card Complete**

☑ **Completed** (but many entries are "none" or "not specified")

## **RG2 — A0 Admissibility Declaration Complete**

☐ **Failed**

**Missing critical elements:**

* No allowed reformulations (no mathematical structure to reformulate)  
* No conservation commitments (no conservation laws exist)  
* No well-posed evolution (no differential equations)  
* No physical equivalence standard (only computational outcomes)

## **RG3 — Forbidden Moves Pre-Screen**

Potential violations detected:

* **F-02 (Horizon Agency):** Black holes described as active agents ("entropy equalizers," "cosmic garbage collection")  
* **F-04 (Bookkeeping \= Dynamics):** "Rendering" threshold Γ determines what is physical  
* **F-07 (Teleological Parameters):** Γ, ε appear chosen to match desired outcomes (S ≈ 2.82, cosmic acceleration)

## **RG4 — Diagnostic Criteria Predeclared**

☑ **Yes** (D1, D2, D3, C1, S1 specified)

## **RG5 — Null Binding Acknowledged**

☑ **Yes**

## **RUN VALIDITY GATE VERDICT**

**Status:** ❌ **FAILED**

**Reason:** Model does not satisfy minimum requirements for conservation-honest audit:

1. **No conservation accounting** \- No stress-energy tensor, no continuity equations  
2. **No physical DOF** \- Only computational variables (C(t), Γ, ε)  
3. **No equations of motion** \- No Lagrangian, no field equations, no geodesics  
4. **Mechanism is definitional** \- Expansion \= "more iterations" is not a physical explanation

## **ALTERNATIVE CLASSIFICATIONS**

### **Option A: Underspecified**

Model lacks sufficient structure for CEDA diagnostics.

### **Option B: Not Auditable (Category Error)**

Model is computational simulation, not physical cosmology. CEDA applies only to theories claiming physical mechanism for early-universe behavior.

### **Option C: Proceed with Diagnostic (For Pedagogical Value)**

Run diagnostics to demonstrate **why** computational metaphors fail conservation-honest accounting, even if formal verdict is predetermined.

---

# **RECOMMENDED ACTION**

**I recommend Option C:** Proceed with diagnostic execution for **pedagogical demonstration**.

This will show:

1. How CEDA distinguishes computational analogy from physical mechanism  
2. Where "rendering as explanation" fails conservation discipline  
3. Why parameters like Γ cannot substitute for genuine dynamics

The verdict will be: **Classification: Reinterpretation (Computational Metaphor) / Failed Run Validity Gate**

But the diagnostic report will document the structural failures explicitly.

---

**Shall I: 2**

1. ✅ **Proceed with full diagnostic execution** (pedagogical value)  
2. ⏹️ **Stop here with Run Validity Gate failure** (formal protocol)  
3. 🔄 **Request author clarification** (give model best chance)
