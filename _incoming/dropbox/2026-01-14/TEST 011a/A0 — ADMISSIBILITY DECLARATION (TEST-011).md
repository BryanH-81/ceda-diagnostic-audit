### **A0.1 Framework Ontology**

☑ **Hybrid** \- Claims computational substrate with emergent geometric structure

**Ontological claims (author-stated):**

* Spacetime is "continuous, self-similar fractal information structure"  
* Matter is "user interface," geometry is "operating system"  
* Physical reality emerges from "rendering" of geometric potential

**Fundamental vs Emergent:**

* **Fundamental:** Fractal seed C(t), geometric potential field  
* **Emergent:** Spacetime, particles, forces  
* **Unclear:** What substrate executes the "computation"?

---

### **A0.2 Allowed Reformulations**

Author does **not specify** equivalent descriptions.

**Inferred constraints:**

* ☐ Field redefinitions (no fields defined)  
* ☐ Frame changes (no frames specified)  
* ☐ Gauge choices (no gauge structure)  
* ☑ Computational parameter changes (Γ, ε treated as tunable)

**Critical issue:** No mathematical structure exists to reformulate.

---

### **A0.3 Allowed Coarse-Grainings**

**Author's implicit prescription:**

* Coarse-graining scale: Grid resolution in 2D simulations  
* What is traced out: "Non-rendered" geometric regions (claimed to be Dark Matter)  
* What must remain fixed: Fractal seed C(t)

**Physical vs descriptive:** Author treats this as **physical** (rendering threshold Γ determines observability)

**CEDA flag:** This conflates computational implementation with physical mechanism.

---

### **A0.4 Physical Equivalence Standard**

**Author claims (implicit):**

* "Same physics" \= same fractal seed C(t) and resonance outcomes  
* Observables: Detection probabilities, Bell correlations, density distributions

**No claim made about:**

* Metric equivalence  
* Stress-energy conservation  
* Causal structure preservation

---

### **A0.5 Symmetry Commitments**

☐ Diffeomorphism invariance (not mentioned)  
 ☐ Lorentz invariance (not addressed)  
 ☑ Fractal self-similarity (claimed but not formalized)

**Author treats symmetry as:** Computational property (iterative seed function)

---

### **A0.6 Conservation Commitments**

**No explicit conservation laws stated.**

Author mentions:

* Black holes "sequester entropy"  
* "Thermal leakage" (Hawking radiation analog)  
* No energy-momentum tensor  
* No continuity equations

**CEDA flag:** Conservation accounting **missing entirely**.

---

### **A0.7 Causal Structure**

**Author's treatment:**

* Causality \= "sequential rendering"  
* "Physical distance is illusion"  
* Entanglement \= "geometric synchrony via shared seed"

☐ Local light-cone causality  
 ☑ Emergent causal ordering (claimed)  
 ☑ Nonlocal but causal (via computational substrate)

**CEDA assessment:** Causal structure is **undefined at physical level**, exists only at computational metaphor level.

---

### **A0.8 Well-Posed Evolution**

**Evolution mechanism (author-stated):**

* Time \= iteration count  
* Evolution \= increasing fractal resolution  
* Field update \= C(t) recalculation per iteration

**No differential equations.**  
 **No initial data specification.**  
 **No breakdown criteria.**

---

### **A0.9 Explicit Non-Equivalences**

Author does not specify what changes would constitute different physics.

---

### **A0.10 Admissibility Acknowledgment**

**CEDA Assessment:**

This model **cannot satisfy A0** as written. It provides:

* No mathematical structure for equivalence testing  
* No conservation laws to preserve  
* No well-defined degrees of freedom beyond computational variables  
* No connection to established physical frameworks (GR, QFT)

**Provisional decision:** Proceed with card generation to document what *is* claimed, but **expect Run Validity Gate failure**.
