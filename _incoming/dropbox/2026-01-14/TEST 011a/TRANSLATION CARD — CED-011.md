## **T1. Native Description Summary**

**Author's framing:** "Universe as fractal information structure where physical reality emerges from computational rendering of geometric potential. Quantum correlations and cosmic expansion are artifacts of fractal geometry processing."

**Primary DOF (as named):**

* C(t): Fractal potential field  
* Γ, ε: Phase transition parameters  
* ρ: Density/complexity field

**Claimed mechanism:** "Sequential rendering" of fractal geometry produces spacetime, particles, forces, and expansion as emergent phenomena.

## **T2. Degrees of Freedom Mapping**

| Native DOF | CEDA Classification | Dynamically Accessible? | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| C(t) \= sin(t)·cos(t·φ) | Computational function | N/A | Not a physical field with dynamics |
| Γ ≈ 0.82 | Free parameter | N/A | Rendering threshold, tunable |
| ε ≈ 0.35 | Free parameter | N/A | Noise amplitude, tunable |
| ρ(x,y,t) | Grid variable | N/A | 2D simulation output |
| φ (golden ratio) | Mathematical constant | N/A | Not dynamic |

**CEDA note:** No physical DOF exist. All variables are computational.

## **T3. System-Environment Partition**

**Interior domain:** Regions where ρ \> Γ ("rendered" as observable matter)

**Environment:** Regions where ρ \< Γ ("non-rendered" \= Dark Matter)

**Justification:** Author's rendering threshold criterion

**CEDA flag:** This partition is **computational**, not causal. It does not correspond to tracing out physically inaccessible degrees of freedom.

## **T4. Horizon / Boundary Interpretation**

**Horizon type:** Black hole event horizon (mentioned)

**Role assigned:** ☑ Computational construct ("recursion limit")  
 ☐ Boundary only  
 ☐ Descriptive regulator

**CEDA flag:** Horizon is treated as **computational failure mode** (infinite loop), not causal boundary.

---

## **T5. Coarse-Graining Interpretation**

**Scale:** Grid spacing in 2D simulations (unspecified in physical units)

**Traced out:** Subgrid fluctuations (if any)

**Held fixed:** C(t) functional form

**Source:** ☑ Inferred by auditor (author does not discuss coarse-graining explicitly)

---

## **T6. Exchange-Term Mapping**

**Exchange terms present?** ☐ No

**No stress-energy tensor exists.** No energy-momentum exchange can be defined.

---

## **T7. Translation Confidence**

☑ **Low** \- Multiple inequivalent interpretations possible

**Reasons:**

1. Author uses metaphorical language ("rendering," "operating system") without mathematical formalization  
2. No clear mapping to physical DOF or fields  
3. Computational variables (Γ, ε) have no physical derivation  
4. Cannot distinguish "what author means physically" from "computational implementation choice"

**Critical ambiguity:** Is this:

* (A) A claim that universe literally runs on computational substrate?  
* (B) An analogy where universe "behaves as if" computed?  
* (C) A simulation demonstrating possible mechanism?

Author language suggests (A), but provides no ontology for what executes the computation.
