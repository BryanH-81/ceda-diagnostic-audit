## **1\. Claimed Mechanism (Author-Stated)**

"The universe is a continuous, self-similar fractal information structure. Disparate phenomena—from Bell inequality violations to cosmic acceleration—emerge as artifacts of fractal geometry rendering. Black Holes act as entropy equalizers, and Dark Matter is redefined as non-rendered geometric processing latency."

**Acceleration mechanism:** Cosmic expansion is "increase in fractal resolution" as system calculates "finer geometric details."

---

## **2\. Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**

### **Explicit DOF:**

* **C(t)** \- "Fractal fabric" potential field: C(t) \= sin(t) · cos(t · φ)  
* **φ** \- Golden ratio (≈ 1.618)  
* **t** \- Temporal coordinate / iteration count

### **Effective/Collective DOF:**

* **Γ ≈ 0.82** \- "Coupling constant" (resonance threshold)  
* **ε ≈ 0.35** \- "Thermal noise" (stochastic perturbation)  
* **ρ(x,y,t)** \- Density field on 2D grid

### **What is not allowed to vary:**

* Fractal seed structure C(t)  
* Golden ratio φ (fixed constant)

**CEDA note:** These are computational variables, not physical degrees of freedom with equations of motion.

---

## **3\. Partition Definition**

### **System:**

"Rendered" geometric regions where ρ \> Γ (above resonance threshold)

### **Environment:**

"Non-rendered" regions where ρ \< Γ (below threshold) \- claimed to be Dark Matter

### **Boundary definition:**

Threshold surface at ρ \= Γ

**CEDA flag:** This is a **computational rendering criterion**, not a physical partition based on causal structure.

---

## **4\. Conservation Accounting**

### **Stress-energy used:**

None specified. No T\_μν, no energy density, no pressure.

### **Effective terms:**

* Author mentions "curvature (computational weight)"  
* "Gravity is gradient of fractal complexity"  
* No mathematical formulation provided

### **Where conservation is enforced:**

**Nowhere.** No conservation laws stated or enforced.

**CEDA flag:** This is a **critical failure** \- no conservation accounting exists.

---

## **5\. Horizon Use**

### **Horizon definition:**

Black hole event horizons mentioned as "recursion limit"

### **Evolution:**

"Information density exceeds local processing capacity → recursive loop"

### **What depends on it:**

* Entropy sequestration  
* Hawking radiation analog ("thermal leakage")

**CEDA flag:** Horizon treated as **computational construct**, not causal boundary.

---

## **6\. Coarse-Graining Prescription**

### **Smoothing scale:**

Grid resolution in 2D simulations (not specified in physical units)

### **Justification:**

Computational implementation choice

### **Admissible variations:**

Author does not discuss; Γ and ε appear tunable to match desired outcomes

**CEDA flag:** Coarse-graining is **computational artifact**, not physical necessity.

---

## **7\. Where Negative Pressure Lives**

### **Equation(s):**

None provided.

### **Physical source:**

Author claims: "Advancement of time increases fractal resolution, creating new space"

**Author's explanation:** Cosmic acceleration is **definitional** \- more iterations \= higher resolution \= more spatial detail \= apparent expansion

**CEDA assessment:** This is **not negative pressure**. No stress-energy tensor, no equation of state, no physical mechanism. Expansion is a **computational artifact** of increasing mesh resolution.

---

## **8\. Diagnostics To Run**

☑ **D1** \- Horizon Reconfiguration Null (primary test \- is "rendering" doing physical work?)  
 ☑ **D2** \- Coarse-Graining Stability (does behavior depend on Γ, ε tuning?)  
 ☑ **D3** \- Exchange-Term Provenance (no exchange terms exist \- conservation not enforced)  
 ☑ **C1** \- Coupling Provenance (are Γ, ε genuine constraints or free parameters?)  
 ☑ **S1** \- Scheme/State Dependence (computational vs physical)  
 ☐ **D4** \- Predictive Wedge (cannot apply \- no observables defined)

---

## **9\. Notes / Risks**

### **Critical Issues:**

1. **No physical equations** \- Entire framework is computational metaphor  
2. **No connection to GR** \- No metric, no Einstein equations, no geodesics  
3. **No connection to QM** \- Bell simulation is statistical, not quantum mechanical  
4. **Parameters appear tuned** \- Γ ≈ 0.82, ε ≈ 0.35 chosen to reproduce desired S ≈ 2.82  
5. **Expansion is definitional** \- Not a physical mechanism, but consequence of "more computation"

### **Likely Outcome:**

**Run Validity Gate FAILURE** due to:

* Missing conservation accounting  
* Undefined physical degrees of freedom  
* No well-posed evolution equations  
* Computational metaphor substituting for mechanism

### **Fallback Position:**

If author claims this is a "computational model" not subject to CEDA criteria, then:

* Model is **outside CEDA scope** (not a physical cosmology)  
* Cannot be audited as early-universe mechanism  
* Classification: **Not Auditable (Computational Simulation, Not Physical Theory)**
