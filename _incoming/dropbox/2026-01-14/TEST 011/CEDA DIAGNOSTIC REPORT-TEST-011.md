**Model:** Meta-Quantum Framework (MQF)  
 **Paper:** *From Quantum Entanglement to Fractal Cosmology: A Computational Unification via Meta-Quantum Framework*  
 **Authors:** Gilmar Bezerra da Cruz *et al.*  
 **Audit Framework:** CEDA v1.2  
 **Date Executed:** 2026-01-14

## **1\. Executive Verdict**

**Final Classification:** **Reinterpretation**  
 **Verdict Stability:** **Stable across all admissible branches**  
 **Conditional Tags:** None

The Meta-Quantum Framework does not earn early-universe acceleration as a physical mechanism under conservation-honest accounting. All inflation-like behavior arises from descriptive or bookkeeping choices rather than intrinsic dynamical degrees of freedom.

---

## **2\. Scope of the Audit**

TEST-011 evaluates whether MQF introduces a genuine dynamical mechanism for cosmological expansion or whether its claims reduce to reinterpretation of known inflation-adjacent behavior through quantum-informational language.

The audit strictly enforces:

* explicit degree-of-freedom accounting,

* conservation discipline,

* admissible coarse-graining,

* and mandatory branching where interpretation is non-unique.

No empirical adequacy claims are assessed.

---

## **3\. Source Provenance**

The audit is based exclusively on the preprint archived in:

`00-SOURCE-011.md`

No post-diagnostic material or external clarification was consulted.

---

## **4\. Diagnostic Branches Executed**

Branching was required due to admissible ambiguities in:

* horizon interpretation,

* exchange-term status,

* conservation enforcement,

* and coarse-graining fixity.

### **Branch A — Conservative / Descriptive**

* Horizon treated as bookkeeping boundary

* Exchange treated as descriptive redistribution

* Geometry treated as diagnostic readout

* Conservation enforced globally/statistically

### **Branch B — Strong Emergence**

* Horizon treated as effective causal boundary

* Exchange treated as physical contribution

* Geometry treated as dynamically relevant

* Conservation treated as emergent-local

No averaging between branches was permitted.

---

## **5\. Diagnostic Results**

### **D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test**

* **Branch A:** **Pass (Null confirmed)**  
   Repartitioning entanglement DOF does not produce sustained negative pressure.

* **Branch B:** **Fail**  
   Acceleration appears only when the horizon is promoted beyond bookkeeping, violating the non-agency rule.

### **D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability**

* **Result:** **Fail (both branches)**  
   Inflation-like behavior varies at order unity under admissible changes in entanglement scale, network resolution, or computational depth.

### **D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance**

* **Result:** **Fail (both branches)**  
   Exchange terms are implicit, non-derived, and function as outcome-regulating placeholders rather than conserved dynamical flows.

### **D4 — Predictive Wedge Requirement**

* **Result:** **Fail (both branches)**  
   No operational distinction from ΛCDM \+ inflation is produced; no cosmological histories are ruled out.

---

## **6\. Provenance of Acceleration**

* **Source:** Bookkeeping-dependent

* **Localization:** None identified at the level of intrinsic dynamical DOF

* **Stress–Energy:** No explicit, conserved ⟨Tμν⟩ sourcing acceleration

Acceleration appears only after informational coarse-graining and interpretive mapping of entanglement structure to geometric descriptors.

---

## **7\. Failure Registry Flags Triggered**

* Entropy / information treated as driver

* Privileged coarse-graining

* Underspecified exchange terms

* Horizon agency (Branch B)

* Descriptive non-existence (CDT-triggered)

---

## **8\. Verdict Stability Assessment**

* Branch A verdict: **Reinterpretation**

* Branch B verdict: **Reinterpretation**

**Verdict convergence:** Yes  
 **Stability:** Strong

The identical classification across mutually exclusive interpretations confirms that the verdict is not contingent on translation choice.

---

## **9\. Conditions Required to Change the Verdict**

To qualify as a physical mechanism under CEDA, the model would need to demonstrate **all** of the following:

1. An explicit, conserved ⟨Tμν⟩ sourced by entanglement or computational degrees of freedom.

2. Exchange terms derived solely from declared partition evolution.

3. Stability of acceleration under admissible coarse-graining variation.

4. A predictive constraint that reduces cosmological histories (C1 pass).

Absent these, the classification remains fixed.

---

## **10\. Final Statement**

The Meta-Quantum Framework is conceptually ambitious and mathematically suggestive, but under conservation-honest audit it reorganizes description without introducing new dynamics. CEDA therefore classifies MQF as a **reinterpretation**, not a mechanism, across its entire declared regime.

**TEST-011 STATUS:** **COMPLETE**
