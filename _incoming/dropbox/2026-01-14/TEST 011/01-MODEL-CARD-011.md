## **1\. Claimed Mechanism (Concise)**

The proposal claims that large-scale cosmological structure and expansion emerge from the organization of quantum entanglement within a Meta-Quantum Framework (MQF), where computational and informational relationships give rise to a fractal spacetime geometry. This emergent geometry is asserted to account for inflation-like behavior and cosmic structure without invoking a traditional inflaton field or standard early-universe dynamics.

## **2\. Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**

### **Explicit Dynamical DOF**

* Quantum states participating in entanglement networks

* Entanglement links / correlations between quantum subsystems

* Computational or algorithmic structures governing state evolution (as defined by MQF)

### **Effective / Collective DOF**

* Emergent spacetime geometry

* Fractal scaling parameters describing large-scale structure

* Effective information or entropy densities treated as physically relevant

### **Fixed / Constrained Quantities**

* Global quantum framework assumptions

* Background conservation principles (typically assumed, not explicitly derived)

* Abstract computational rules of the MQF

## **3\. System–Environment Partition**

* **System (interior degrees of freedom):**  
   Quantum states and entanglement structures identified with the emergent cosmological bulk or observable universe.

* **Environment (exterior / traced-out degrees of freedom):**  
   Inaccessible, unobserved, or coarse-grained quantum information outside the chosen entanglement or computational cutoff.

* **Boundary definition:**  
   An implicit informational or entanglement boundary, sometimes associated with observational limits or computational resolution rather than a classical causal horizon.

* **Time evolution of partition:**  
   The partition may evolve as entanglement structure or computational depth increases, though no explicit dynamical rule is universally specified.

---

## **4\. Conservation Accounting**

* **Stress–energy tensor used:**  
   Not explicitly defined in standard ⟨Tμν⟩ form; effective geometric or informational quantities are often treated as sourcing spacetime structure.

* **Additional or effective terms introduced:**  
   Information- or entanglement-based contributions to effective geometry.

* **Where conservation is enforced:**  
   Conservation is typically asserted at a global or emergent level rather than demonstrated through explicit local continuity equations.

---

## **5\. Horizon Use (if applicable)**

* **Horizon definition:**  
   Non-classical; often described as an informational, entanglement, or computational boundary.

* **Role in the argument:**  
   Primarily descriptive and organizational, regulating which degrees of freedom contribute to the effective description.

* **Quantities depending on horizon choice:**  
   Effective geometry, scaling relations, and emergent cosmological behavior may depend on the chosen informational or entanglement cutoff.

---

## **6\. Coarse-Graining Prescription**

* **Smoothing / coarse-graining scales:**  
   Entanglement scale, network resolution, or computational depth.

* **Justification for choice:**  
   Motivated by informational accessibility or computational tractability rather than classical EFT cutoff arguments.

* **Range of admissible variations:**  
   Not explicitly bounded or systematically explored.

---

## **7\. Location of Negative Pressure / Acceleration**

* **Equation references:**  
   Typically expressed through emergent geometric or scaling relations rather than explicit fluid equations.

* **Responsible terms:**  
   Fractal or informational contributions to effective geometry.

* **Physical source:**  
   Emergent collective behavior of entanglement and computational structure, not a localized dynamical field.

## **8\. Diagnostics Requested**

* D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test

* D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability

* D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance

* D4 — Mechanism Audit

---

## **9\. Known Fragilities / Author Caveats**

* Reliance on emergent and interpretive mappings between quantum information and spacetime geometry

* Limited explicit demonstration of conservation at the local stress–energy level

* Dependence on chosen entanglement or computational scales, which may affect emergent behavior
