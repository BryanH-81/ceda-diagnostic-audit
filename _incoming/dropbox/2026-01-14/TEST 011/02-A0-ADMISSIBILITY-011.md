## **A0 — Admissibility Declaration**

**Model:** Meta-Quantum Framework (MQF)  
 **Audit:** TEST-011

---

## **A0.1 Framework Ontology**

**Declared descriptive level (check all that apply):**

* ☐ Continuum EFT

* ☐ Discrete / lattice

* ☐ Holographic / dual

* ☐ Nonlocal / integral kernel

* ☑ **Hybrid** — quantum-information / computational substrate with emergent spacetime geometry

**Ontology statement (as implied by the paper):**  
 Spacetime geometry is **emergent**, arising from quantum entanglement and computational/informational structure. Degrees of freedom are fundamentally quantum and pre-geometric; spacetime, curvature, and cosmological dynamics are collective, emergent descriptions.

---

## **A0.2 Allowed Reformulations (Equivalence Claims)**

The following reformulations are **implicitly treated as equivalent** within the MQF proposal:

* ☑ Change of variables between:

  * entanglement measures

  * information density

  * fractal geometric descriptors

* ☑ Re-expression of informational structure as emergent spacetime geometry

The following are **not explicitly declared but appear assumed**:

* ☐ Field redefinitions (classical fields not fundamental)

* ☐ Frame changes (Jordan ↔ Einstein not discussed)

* ☐ Gauge choices (no explicit gauge structure declared)

* ☐ Duality maps (no explicit dual correspondence specified)

**Equivalence criterion (implicit):**  
 Two descriptions are treated as physically equivalent if they reproduce the same large-scale geometric or cosmological behavior (e.g., expansion, scaling laws), even if underlying representations differ.

⚠️ No explicit invariant set (observables, conserved quantities, or causal structure) is formally declared.

---

## **A0.3 Allowed Coarse-Grainings**

* **Coarse-graining scales:**

  * Entanglement resolution

  * Network or graph scale

  * Computational depth / informational cutoff

* **What is traced out / averaged over:**

  * Fine-grained entanglement structure

  * Inaccessible or unobserved quantum information

  * High-resolution computational details

* **What must remain fixed:**

  * Global informational structure

  * Qualitative scaling behavior of emergent geometry

**Nature of coarse-graining:**  
 ☑ **Descriptive** (multiple equivalent choices appear allowed)  
 ☐ Physical (not dictated by a unique causal or dynamical rule)

---

## **A0.4 Physical Equivalence Standard**

The model treats the following as indicators of “same physics”:

* Qualitatively identical emergent spacetime geometry

* Similar large-scale cosmological scaling behavior

* Reproduction of observed cosmic structure patterns

The model does **not** explicitly require invariance of:

* Local stress–energy tensor structure

* Local conservation equations

* Causal propagation structure at the spacetime level

---

## **A0.5 Symmetry Commitments**

Explicit symmetry commitments are **not formally enumerated**.

Implicitly assumed:

* ☐ Diffeomorphism invariance (emergent, not fundamental)

* ☐ Lorentz invariance (possibly emergent or approximate)

No discrete or gauge symmetries are specified.

---

## **A0.6 Conservation Commitments**

* ☐ Energy–momentum conservation (emergent / implicit)

* ☐ Probability / unitarity (assumed at quantum level)

* ☐ Charge conservation (not discussed)

**Regime of validity:**  
 Conservation laws are assumed to hold globally or statistically, but are not enforced through explicit local continuity equations in the emergent spacetime description.

---

## **A0.7 Causal Structure**

* ☑ Emergent causal ordering

* ☐ Local light-cone causality (not fundamental)

* ☐ Explicit nonlocal kernel (not mathematically specified)

**Horizons are treated as:**  
 ☑ bookkeeping / informational boundaries  
 ☐ dynamical agents (explicitly disclaimed)  
 ☐ classical causal horizons (not primary)

---

## **A0.8 Well-Posed Evolution**

* **Initial data:**  
   Global quantum state and entanglement configuration

* **Evolution rule:**  
   Computational / informational update rules defined by MQF

* **Breakdown criteria:**  
   Not explicitly specified; regime boundaries are qualitative rather than formal

---

## **A0.9 Explicit Non-Equivalences**

The following transformations are **not declared equivalent**, but also not clearly prohibited:

* Changing entanglement cutoff scale

* Changing computational resolution

* Reinterpreting informational measures as geometric quantities

No explicit non-equivalence boundaries are stated.

---

## **A0.10 Admissibility Acknowledgment**

By proceeding under this declaration, the model accepts that:

* Effects that disappear under admissible changes in entanglement scale or coarse-graining will be classified as **descriptive**, not dynamical.

* Undeclared freedoms may not be invoked after diagnostics.

* Equivalence claims based solely on “same qualitative behavior” will be audited under E0 (Equivalence vs Enrichment).
