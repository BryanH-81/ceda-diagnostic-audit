### **Purpose**

This document records **all non-unique but physically admissible translation choices** identified during the Translation Card phase. Any ambiguity capable of altering diagnostic outcomes is explicitly logged. Where required, branching will be triggered in subsequent diagnostic runs.

## **Logged Ambiguities**

### **AB-01 — Nature of the “Horizon” / Boundary**

* **Translation Element:**  
   Horizon / boundary definition

* **Competing Interpretations:**

  * **A:** Informational / entanglement cutoff acting as a descriptive regulator

  * **B:** Effective causal boundary influencing which DOF participate dynamically

* **Physically Admissible under A0?**  
   ☑ Yes (both consistent with declared ontology)

* **Affects Diagnostics?**  
   ☑ Yes (D1, D2, D3)

* **Notes:**  
   Interpretation B risks promoting a bookkeeping boundary into a quasi-dynamical role.

---

### **AB-02 — Exchange-Term Origin**

* **Translation Element:**  
   Exchange of information / entanglement between interior and environment

* **Competing Interpretations:**

  * **A:** Purely descriptive redistribution with no physical sourcing

  * **B:** Effective exchange term contributing to emergent stress–energy

* **Physically Admissible under A0?**  
   ☑ Yes

* **Affects Diagnostics?**  
   ☑ Yes (D3 primarily)

* **Notes:**  
   No explicit continuity equations are provided to resolve this ambiguity.

---

### **AB-03 — Status of Emergent Geometry**

* **Translation Element:**  
   Emergent spacetime geometry

* **Competing Interpretations:**

  * **A:** Diagnostic output only (readout of information structure)

  * **B:** Effective physical geometry sourcing cosmological dynamics

* **Physically Admissible under A0?**  
   ☑ Yes

* **Affects Diagnostics?**  
   ☑ Yes (D1, D4)

* **Notes:**  
   Interpretation B risks circularity if geometry is both output and driver.

---

### **AB-04 — Coarse-Graining Scale Fixity**

* **Translation Element:**  
   Entanglement / computational coarse-graining scale

* **Competing Interpretations:**

  * **A:** Arbitrary but descriptive choice

  * **B:** Physically preferred or dynamically selected scale

* **Physically Admissible under A0?**  
   ☑ Yes

* **Affects Diagnostics?**  
   ☑ Yes (D2)

* **Notes:**  
   No mechanism is provided that selects or stabilizes a unique scale.

---

### **AB-05 — Conservation Enforcement Level**

* **Translation Element:**  
   Conservation laws (energy–momentum)

* **Competing Interpretations:**

  * **A:** Global/statistical conservation only

  * **B:** Effective local conservation in emergent spacetime

* **Physically Admissible under A0?**  
   ☑ Yes

* **Affects Diagnostics?**  
   ☑ Yes (D1, D3)

* **Notes:**  
   Diagnostic outcomes differ sharply depending on whether local conservation is enforced.

---

## **Branching Trigger Assessment**

Applying **BR1 — Trigger Condition**:

At least one ambiguity satisfies both:

* Physically admissible ✔

* Capable of changing diagnostic outcomes ✔

**Result:**  
 ☑ **Branching REQUIRED**

---

## **Required Diagnostic Branches**

Minimum branches to be constructed in diagnostics:

* **Branch A — Conservative / Descriptive Interpretation**

  * Horizon \= bookkeeping only

  * Exchange \= descriptive redistribution

  * Geometry \= readout, not driver

  * Conservation \= global/statistical

* **Branch B — Strong Emergence Interpretation**

  * Horizon \= effective causal boundary

  * Exchange \= effective physical term

  * Geometry \= dynamically relevant

  * Conservation \= emergent-local

No preference assigned.  
 No averaging permitted.
