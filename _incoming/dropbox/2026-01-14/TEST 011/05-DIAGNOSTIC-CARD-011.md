### **Summary Verdict**

**Classification:** **Reinterpretation**  
 **Verdict Stability:** **Stable (all admissible branches agree)**

---

### **Claimed Effect**

Inflation-like expansion and large-scale cosmological structure emerge from quantum entanglement and computational/informational organization, producing an effective fractal spacetime geometry without an inflaton or modified gravity.

---

### **Provenance of Acceleration**

* **Source:** Bookkeeping-dependent (entanglement scaling, informational coarse-graining)

* **Localization:** No intrinsic dynamical DOF identified

* **Stress–Energy:** No explicit, conserved ⟨Tμν⟩ sourcing acceleration

### **Diagnostic Outcomes**

| Test | Result | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null** | Pass / Fail (branch-dependent) | Null holds when horizon is bookkeeping-only; fails if horizon is promoted to agent |
| **D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability** | **Fail** | Inflation-like behavior varies at order unity under admissible scale changes |
| **D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance** | **Fail** | Exchange terms implicit, non-derived, outcome-regulating |
| **D4 — Predictive Wedge** | **Fail** | No operational distinction from ΛCDM \+ inflation |

### **Branching Summary**

* **Branch A (Conservative / Descriptive):** Reinterpretation

* **Branch B (Strong Emergence):** Reinterpretation

**Verdict convergence:** Yes

---

### **Failure Registry Flags**

* Entropy / information treated as driver

* Privileged coarse-graining

* Underspecified exchange

* Horizon agency (conditional, Branch B)

* Descriptive non-existence (CDT)

---

### **What Would Change the Verdict**

To qualify as a **mechanism**, the model would need to:

1. Provide an explicit, conserved ⟨Tμν⟩ sourced by entanglement or computational DOF

2. Derive exchange terms solely from declared partition evolution

3. Demonstrate stability under admissible coarse-graining variation

4. Introduce a constrained predictive wedge (C1 pass)

---

### **Scope Note**

This classification is **structural, not empirical**.  
 The model may be mathematically interesting or phenomenologically suggestive, but under CEDA it does not earn early-universe acceleration as a physical mechanism.
