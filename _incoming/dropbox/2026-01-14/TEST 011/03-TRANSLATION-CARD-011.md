## **T1. Native Description Summary**

**Native model description (as written):**  
 The MQF proposal describes the universe as arising from a quantum-informational substrate in which entanglement and computational processes generate an emergent, fractal spacetime geometry. Cosmological expansion and structure are attributed to scaling properties of entanglement networks rather than to classical fields, inflatons, or modified gravity terms.

**Primary degrees of freedom named by authors:**

* Quantum states

* Entanglement relations / networks

* Computational or algorithmic structures

* Fractal geometric descriptors (emergent)

**Claimed mechanism (1–2 sentences):**  
 Large-scale cosmological behavior emerges from the organization and evolution of quantum entanglement and information within a Meta-Quantum computational framework, producing an effective fractal spacetime geometry that mimics inflation-like expansion.

## **T2. Degrees of Freedom Mapping**

| Native DOF | CEDA Classification | Dynamically Accessible? | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Quantum states | Interior DOF | Yes | Treated as fundamental |
| Entanglement links | Interior DOF | Yes | Collective, relational |
| Computational rules | Interior structure | Yes | Governs evolution |
| Fractal geometry | Effective DOF | Indirect | Emergent description |
| Inaccessible entanglement | Environment DOF | No | Traced out via coarse-graining |

**Explicit notes:**

* Interior DOF: entangled quantum subsystems participating in the emergent bulk.

* Environment DOF: quantum information beyond the entanglement/computational cutoff.

* Effective DOF: geometric and cosmological quantities inferred from information structure.

## **T3. System–Environment Partition**

* **Interior domain definition:**  
   Quantum states and entanglement relations included within the chosen informational or computational resolution.

* **Environment definition:**  
   Degrees of freedom excluded by entanglement scale, network truncation, or computational cutoff.

* **Justification:**  
   Partition is implied by informational accessibility and computational tractability rather than by classical causal horizons.

## **T4. Horizon / Boundary Interpretation**

* **Horizon type used:**  
   Informational / entanglement boundary (non-classical)

* **Role assigned:**  
   ☑ boundary only  
   ☑ descriptive regulator  
   ☐ dynamical role (flagged)

* **Time dependence:**  
   Boundary may evolve as entanglement structure or computational depth evolves, but no explicit evolution law is provided.

---

## **T5. Coarse-Graining Interpretation**

* **Scale(s):**  
   Entanglement resolution, network scale, computational depth

* **What is averaged / traced out:**  
   Fine-grained entanglement structure and inaccessible quantum information

* **What is held fixed:**  
   Qualitative scaling behavior of emergent geometry

* **Declaration status:**  
   ☑ explicitly described in narrative form  
   ☑ partially inferred by auditor (flagged)

---

## **T6. Exchange-Term Mapping**

* **Exchange terms present?**  
   ☑ Yes (implicit)

* **Source classification:**  
   ☐ derived from partition evolution  
   ☑ phenomenological / interpretive  
   ☐ closure assumption (explicit)

* **Schematic form:**  
   Exchange is described qualitatively as redistribution or flow of information/entanglement across the informational boundary, without an explicit conservative continuity equation.

---

## **T7. Translation Confidence**

**Auditor assessment:**  
 ☐ High  
 ☑ **Moderate**  
 ☐ Low

**Rationale:**  
 Multiple plausible translations exist depending on how entanglement cutoffs and computational scales are interpreted. However, all reasonable mappings share dependence on informational coarse-graining and lack explicit stress–energy localization.

## **Translation Status Summary**

* Translation completed without injecting new structure.

* All interpretive choices flagged explicitly.

* Exchange terms identified as implicit and non-derived.

* No diagnostics applied yet.
