# **MODEL DECLARATION — CEDA**

**Audit ID:** CED-\_\_\_  
 **Paper / Proposal:**  
 **Authors:**  
 **Source (arXiv / journal / URL):**  
 **Date of Declaration:**  
 **Declared by:** (auditor)

---

## **1\. Claimed Mechanism (Author Language)**

*In 2–5 sentences, state the mechanism **as the authors claim it**, without reinterpretation, correction, or translation.*

* What is claimed to drive expansion / acceleration?

* What is claimed to replace or supplement inflation (if applicable)?

* What role do horizons, entropy, vacuum energy, or averaging play *as stated*?

⚠️ Do **not** translate into CEDA language here. This is the “native claim.”

---

## **2\. Degrees of Freedom (Explicit)**

List **all degrees of freedom that materially contribute** to the proposal.

### **2.1 Dynamical Degrees of Freedom**

| DOF | Description | Treated as Fundamental? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  |  | ☐ Yes ☐ No |

Examples:

* metric (GR)

* scalar field(s)

* radiation / matter fluids

* tensor modes

* effective vacuum sector

---

### **2.2 Non-Dynamical / Effective / Emergent Quantities**

List quantities that appear **without independent equations of motion**.

Examples:

* entropy densities

* horizon area terms

* coarse-grained stress–energy

* effective equations of state

* running parameters

---

## **3\. System–Environment Partition**

**Interior system definition:**

What region / sector is treated as the evolving system?

**Environment definition:**

What is traced out, averaged over, or treated as external?

**Partition justification:**

Is this partition explicitly stated by the authors, or inferred?

☐ Explicit in paper  
 ☐ Inferred by auditor (flagged)

---

## **4\. Horizon / Boundary Treatment**

**Horizon type(s) used (if any):**  
 ☐ None  
 ☐ Event  
 ☐ Particle  
 ☐ Apparent / Hubble  
 ☐ Effective / coarse-grained  
 ☐ Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Assigned role:**  
 ☐ Causal boundary only  
 ☐ Descriptive regulator (bookkeeping)  
 ☐ Dynamical / agentic (⚠️ flagged)

**Time dependence:**

Is the horizon treated as fixed, evolving, or redefined?

---

## **5\. Exchange Terms & Conservation Structure**

**Are exchange terms present in effective continuity equations?**  
 ☐ Yes ☐ No

If **Yes**, specify:

* Form of exchange term(s):  
   Q=Q \=Q= \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* Origin (check one):  
   ☐ Derived from partition evolution  
   ☐ Derived from microphysics  
   ☐ Phenomenological / closure assumption  
   ☐ Unspecified

**Global conservation asserted?**  
 ☐ Explicitly  
 ☐ Implicitly  
 ☐ Not stated

---

## **6\. Coarse-Graining & Averaging Assumptions**

**Coarse-graining scale(s):**

(physical scale, horizon scale, EFT cutoff, smoothing window, etc.)

**What is averaged / traced out:**

**What is held fixed:**

☐ Coarse-graining explicitly declared  
 ☐ Coarse-graining inferred by auditor (flagged)

---

## **7\. Location of Accelerated Expansion / Negative Pressure**

**Where does acceleration originate according to the model?**

☐ Explicit stress–energy component  
 ☐ Effective equation of state  
 ☐ Boundary / horizon contribution  
 ☐ Entropy / information term  
 ☐ Averaging / backreaction  
 ☐ Assumed background (e.g. de Sitter)

Brief explanation (1–2 sentences):

---

## **8\. Translation Confidence**

Auditor assessment of how uniquely this model maps into CEDA primitives:

☐ **High** — essentially unique translation  
 ☐ **Moderate** — minor admissible alternatives  
 ☐ **Low** — multiple inequivalent interpretations possible

If **Moderate or Low**, list the dominant ambiguity:

---

## **9\. Declaration Status**

☐ Complete  
 ☐ Incomplete (diagnostic run blocked)

**Notes (optional):**

---

### **CEDA Use Rule**

This document is **binding** for the diagnostic run.  
 No later reinterpretation may alter declared DOF, partitions, or exchange structure.
