# **CEDA Audit Index**

This directory contains completed **Cosmological Explanation Diagnostic Audits (CEDA)**.  
 Each audit applies the same conservation-honest protocol to evaluate whether a proposal’s claimed behavior arises from **intrinsic dynamics** or **descriptive bookkeeping**.

Audits are frozen on completion. Verdicts are not revised retroactively.

## **Audit Descriptions**

### **CEDA-001 — Watson–Perry–Kane–Adams (2007)**

Early-universe proposal audited for conservation structure, degree-of-freedom discipline, and effective stress–energy construction.

→ `CEDA-001-watson-perry-kane-adams-2007/`

---

### **CEDA-002 — Easson, Frampton & Smoot (2011)**

Horizon-thermodynamic acceleration proposal.  
 Acceleration traced to horizon screen pressure inserted directly into the acceleration equation without a conserved dynamical carrier.

**Verdict:** Reinterpretation (bookkeeping-dependent acceleration)

→ `CEDA-002-easson-frampton-smoot-2011/`

---

### **CEDA-003 — Horizon / Entanglement–Driven Acceleration (Class Audit)**

Class-level audit of proposals attributing acceleration to horizon structure, entanglement entropy, or information-theoretic effects without introducing new propagating degrees of freedom.

**Verdict:** Reinterpretation class  
 (No member demonstrates intrinsic acceleration under conservation-honest accounting.)

→ `CEDA-003-horizon-entanglement/`

---

### **CEDA-004 — Starobinsky Inflation**

Benchmark audit of a successful inflationary model with explicit dynamical origin (higher-curvature action).

**Verdict:** Pass  
 (Acceleration sourced by intrinsic dynamics.)

→ `CEDA-004-starobinsky/`

---

## **Reading Order (Recommended)**

For new readers:

1. `CEDA-002` — concrete horizon-based failure

2. `CEDA-003` — class-level structural diagnosis

3. `CEDA-004` — clean dynamical pass (contrast case)

This sequence illustrates what CEDA distinguishes **and why**.

---

## **Notes on Interpretation**

* A **Reinterpretation** verdict does *not* imply mathematical inconsistency.

* It indicates that the claimed physical behavior arises from descriptive choices rather than conserved dynamical mechanisms.

* CEDA does not adjudicate observational success.
