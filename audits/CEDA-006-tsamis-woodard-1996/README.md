# CEDA-006 — Tsamis & Woodard (1996)

This audit targets the claim that quantum gravitational infrared effects (graviton loops)
produce a secular backreaction which slows an initially de Sitter inflationary expansion.

Primary reference:

- N.C. Tsamis & R.P. Woodard, "Quantum Gravity Slows Inflation" (hep-ph/9602315)

CEDA focus:

- Whether the secular slowing of H(t) constitutes a genuine mechanism (derived, gauge-robust,
  and coarse-graining stable), or whether it is description-sensitive (gauge/observable choice,
  regulator dependence, or perturbation-breakdown ambiguity).

Diagnostics emphasized:

- D2 (coarse-graining / nonlocal / regulator stability)
- D4 (predictive wedge / observable definition)
  D3 is assessed as an internal gravitational-sector exchange rather than a two-fluid bookkeeping split.
