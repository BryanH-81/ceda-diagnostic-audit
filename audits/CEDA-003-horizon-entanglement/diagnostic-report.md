CEDA Diagnostic Report

Audit ID: CEDA-003-horizon-entanglement
Audit Type: Class Audit (Structural)
Class Name: Horizon / Entanglement–Driven Acceleration
Framework Version: CEDA v1.0
Analyst: CEDA
Status: Final (verdict locked)

Summary Verdict

Verdict: Reinterpretation Class (No Intrinsic Acceleration Mechanism)

Across the class of horizon- and entanglement-driven acceleration proposals, no member demonstrates accelerated expansion arising from intrinsic dynamical degrees of freedom. Apparent acceleration is consistently produced through descriptive bookkeeping tied to horizon structure, entanglement measures, or information-theoretic reinterpretation rather than conserved physical dynamics.

Scope of This Audit

This diagnostic applies to proposals that share the following structural features:

Acceleration attributed to horizon structure, entanglement entropy, or information flow

No new propagating fields or explicit modification of the gravitational action

Reliance on effective pressure or energy terms derived from horizon or entanglement arguments

The verdict applies at the class level. Individual papers may differ in presentation, but share the same explanatory structure.

Key Findings

Negative pressure is consistently attributed to horizons, entanglement boundaries, or informational constructs rather than material stress–energy components.

Acceleration enters cosmological equations via effective or phenomenological terms not derived from a covariant action.

Standard conservation laws are typically assumed for matter sectors without a corresponding exchange or bookkeeping mechanism for the horizon/entanglement contribution.

Provenance of Acceleration / Negative Pressure

Origin: Descriptive / bookkeeping-dependent

Carrier: Horizon screens, entanglement entropy, or information-theoretic quantities

Localization: Not associated with propagating fields or conserved stress–energy tensors

Acceleration is introduced through reinterpretation of boundary or coarse-grained quantities rather than intrinsic dynamics.

Diagnostic Test Outcomes (Class-Level)
D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Without Added Dynamics

Result: FAIL (Class-Wide)

Evidence:
All class members rely on reclassification of horizon or entanglement properties without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom. As established by the WF1.2 null control and confirmed by CEDA-002, horizon or entanglement bookkeeping alone cannot generically generate sustained negative pressure under conservation-honest accounting.

D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability

Result: FAIL (Class-Wide)

Evidence:
Acceleration depends on privileged choices of horizon definition, entanglement partition, or coarse-graining scale. No proposal in the class demonstrates invariance of the acceleration effect under admissible variations of boundary definition or coarse-graining prescription.

D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance (Anti Goal-Seeking)

Result: FAIL (Class-Wide)

Evidence:
Effective acceleration terms enter cosmological equations without an explicit exchange term or closed conservation mechanism linking horizon/entanglement sectors to interior matter. Conservation is preserved only by assumption, not by derivation.

D4 — Predictive Wedge Requirement

Result: FAIL (Class-Wide)

Evidence:
The class does not provide operationally distinct, falsifiable predictions separating it from standard ΛCDM or inflationary dynamics. Claims of novelty rest on interpretive framing rather than measurable differences.

Failure Registry IDs Triggered

F-01: Entropy-as-driver

F-02: Horizon agency

F-03: Privileged coarse-graining

F-06: Descriptive non-existence (acceleration without dynamical carrier)

What Would Need to Be True to Change the Verdict

For any member of this class to escape the verdict, all of the following would be required:

Introduction of a covariant, dynamical degree of freedom or action-level modification sourcing acceleration.

Explicit localization of negative pressure within a conserved stress–energy sector or closed exchange framework.

Demonstration that the acceleration effect is invariant under admissible horizon and coarse-graining redefinitions.

A falsifiable predictive wedge distinguishing the proposal from ΛCDM/inflation beyond reinterpretation.

Absent these conditions, the class remains non-dynamical.

Final Classification

CEDA Classification:
❌ Not a viable mechanism for intrinsic cosmic acceleration
✔ Canonical class of horizon/entanglement-based inflation mimicry
✔ Suitable as a negative control for testing conservation-honest diagnostics

Status

CEDA-003 is now locked.
