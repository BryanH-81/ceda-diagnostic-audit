\# CEDA-Audit-002 — Horizon / Entanglement–Driven Inflation Claims



\*\*Audit focus:\*\* Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test (D1)



This directory contains a Cosmological Explanation Diagnostic Audit (CEDA)

applied to early-universe proposals that attribute accelerated expansion to

horizon structure, entanglement entropy, or thermodynamic reinterpretation

without introducing explicit dynamical exchange terms.



---



\## Why This Class of Proposal Matters



These models often:

\- avoid introducing scalar inflaton fields

\- preserve formal energy–momentum conservation

\- attribute causal efficacy to horizons, entropy, or accessibility

\- claim inflation-like behavior emerges “automatically”



They frequently pass casual consistency checks while failing to specify

where negative pressure or acceleration physically resides.

\## Primary Diagnostic Questions



1\. Does the horizon act as a \*\*causal agent\*\* or a \*\*descriptive boundary\*\*?

2\. Are entropy or entanglement treated as \*\*state-counting\*\* or \*\*dynamics\*\*?

3\. Does accelerated expansion survive when bookkeeping is stripped of agency?
