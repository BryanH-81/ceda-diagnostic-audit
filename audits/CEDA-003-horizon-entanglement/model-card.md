CEDA Model Card (Class Audit)

Audit ID: CEDA-003-horizon-entanglement
Audit Type: Class audit (structural)
Class Name: Horizon / Entanglement–Driven Acceleration
Status: Translation complete (class-level)

A. Class Description (As Claimed)

This class of proposals attributes inflationary or inflation-like accelerated expansion to horizon structure, quantum entanglement entropy, or information-theoretic properties of spacetime. Acceleration is claimed to arise without introducing new propagating fields, explicit potentials, or modifications to the gravitational action.

B. Claimed Mechanism (Generic)

Acceleration arises because changes in horizon entanglement, entropy, or information accessibility generate an effective pressure or force that modifies cosmological dynamics.

Common claims include:

Entanglement entropy contributes to vacuum energy or pressure

Horizon growth alters effective stress–energy

Information flow or accessibility replaces inflaton dynamics

C. Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Inventory (Class-Level)
Dynamical DOF (shared)

FRW spacetime geometry (GR background)

Standard cosmological matter and radiation

Non-dynamical / descriptive quantities (invoked)

Horizons (Hubble, apparent, causal, or entanglement horizons)

Entanglement entropy or information measures

Horizon temperature or modular Hamiltonians

Effective sectors

Emergent pressure/energy terms attributed to entanglement or horizon structure

Common feature:
No independent propagating field or action-level DOF sourcing acceleration.

D. System–Environment Partition

Interior: Cosmological region described by FRW dynamics

Boundary / environment: Horizon or entanglement boundary

Tracing procedure: Typically implicit or unspecified

Partition evolution: Tied to horizon scale or causal structure

E. Coarse-Graining Prescription

Coarse-graining scale: Implicitly horizon-linked

Traced-out DOF: Not explicitly specified

Dependence on slicing/horizon definition: Typically present

No class member provides a coarse-graining prescription invariant under admissible redefinitions.

F. Effective Stress–Energy Construction

Acceleration enters via:

Effective pressure or energy terms attributed to entanglement or horizon structure

Direct modification of Friedmann or acceleration equations

These terms are:

Not derived from a covariant action

Not associated with a conserved stress–energy tensor

G. Conservation and Exchange Accounting

Standard matter continuity usually assumed

No explicit exchange term
𝑄
Q between entanglement/horizon sector and matter

Energy accounting relies on reinterpretation rather than closed dynamics

H. Location of Negative Pressure

Negative pressure is attributed to:

Horizon screens

Entanglement entropy gradients

Information-theoretic constructs

It is not localized to a material or propagating field.

I. Stability Hooks (Class-Level)

Across the class:

Sensitivity to horizon definition is present

Stability under coarse-graining variation is not demonstrated

No invariance principles are declared

J. Predictive Wedge (Class-Level)

Claimed distinction: no inflaton, “deeper” explanation

Operationally distinct predictions: rarely specified

Falsifiability: typically qualitative

Step 2 — Run diagnostics at the class level

Now we apply diagnostics once, but structurally.

D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Without Added Dynamics

Result: FAIL (class-wide)

Reason:
All members rely on reclassification of horizon/entanglement properties without introducing new dynamical DOF. As shown in WF1.2 and CEDA-002, such reclassification cannot generically generate negative pressure under conservation-honest accounting.

D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability

Result: FAIL (class-wide)

Reason:
Acceleration depends on privileged horizon definitions or entanglement partitions. No member demonstrates invariance under admissible coarse-graining or boundary reassignment.

D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance

Result: FAIL (class-wide)

Reason:
Effective pressure enters without a closed exchange mechanism. Conservation is preserved only by assuming the additional term does not require accounting.

D4 — Predictive Wedge

Result: FAIL (class-wide)

Reason:
Outputs are inflation-like with no unique, testable wedge beyond reinterpretation.
