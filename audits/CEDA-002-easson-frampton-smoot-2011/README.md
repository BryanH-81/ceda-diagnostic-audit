\# Easson, Frampton \& Smoot (2011)



\*\*Paper:\*\* \_Entropic Accelerating Universe\_  

\*\*arXiv:\*\* 1002.4278  

\*\*Journal:\*\* Physics Letters B 696 (2011)



This directory contains the Cosmological Explanation Diagnostic Audit (CEDA)

run for the proposal by Easson, Frampton, and Smoot claiming that cosmic

acceleration arises from horizon thermodynamics rather than new matter

fields or explicit inflationary dynamics.

\## Why This Paper Was Selected



This work is a canonical example of a proposal that:



\- Avoids introducing a scalar inflaton field

\- Avoids explicit decay rates or exchange terms

\- Attributes accelerated expansion to \*\*horizon entropy and temperature\*\*

\- Treats the horizon as the origin of an effective force



This places the proposal directly in the scope of \*\*CEDA Diagnostic D1\*\*:

the Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test.
