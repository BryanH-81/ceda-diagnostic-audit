# CEDA-Audit-002

**Paper:** Easson, Frampton & Smoot (2011)  
**Title:** _Entropic Accelerating Universe_  
**arXiv:** 1002.4278  
**Status:** Closed  
**Primary Diagnostic:** D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test  
**Secondary Flags:** F-01 (Entropy as Driver), D4 (Mechanism Equivalence)

## Summary

This audit evaluates the claim that cosmic acceleration can arise from horizon
thermodynamics (entropy/temperature associated with the Hubble horizon) without
introducing new fields, modified gravity, or explicit energy-exchange dynamics.

CEDA treats horizons as descriptive causal boundaries unless independently
promoted to dynamical degrees of freedom with conservation accounting. The
central question is whether the proposal’s acceleration survives when horizon
agency is removed.

---

## Key Finding

The proposal’s acceleration depends on promoting the cosmological horizon from
a descriptive boundary to a causal agent (“entropic force”). Once the horizon is
treated strictly as non-dynamical bookkeeping, no physical source remains for
the additional acceleration terms. No stress–energy tensor, field, fluid, or
conserved exchange term is introduced to carry negative pressure.

**Result:** the mechanism does not survive the D1 null operation.

## Diagnostic Outcomes

- **D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test:** **FAIL**  
  Horizon agency is required for acceleration. Removing agency removes the effect.

- **D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability:** **FLAGGED**  
  The construction privileges a horizon-scale thermodynamic description without
  showing invariance under admissible coarse-graining changes.

- **D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance:** **PASS**  
  No explicit \(Q\)-terms, decay rates, or injected exchange dynamics appear.

- **D4 — Mechanism Audit:** **FLAGGED**  
  The modification functions as an effective equation-of-state reparameterization
  rather than a mechanism introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom.

## CEDA Classification

**Primary classification:** **D1 Failure — Horizon Agency**  
**Secondary classification:** **F-01 Entropy as Driver**  
**Additional flag:** **D4 Mechanism Equivalence**

## Notes

This audit serves as a canonical D1 example: a proposal that is formally
conservation-respecting and field-minimal, yet derives acceleration by granting
causal power to horizon/entropy bookkeeping without specifying dynamical degrees
of freedom or a conservation ledger.

**Audit-002 complements Audit-001:** where Audit-001 fails via explicit exchange
injection (D3), Audit-002 fails via descriptive boundary agency (D1).
