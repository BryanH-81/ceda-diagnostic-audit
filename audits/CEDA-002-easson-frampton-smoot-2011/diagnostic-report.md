Summary Verdict

Verdict: Reinterpretation (Bookkeeping-Dependent Acceleration)

The proposal does not introduce a new dynamical mechanism capable of generating accelerated expansion. Apparent acceleration arises from horizon-associated bookkeeping terms inserted directly into the cosmological acceleration equation without an underlying covariant dynamical origin.

Key Findings

Negative pressure is explicitly localized to a horizon “screen,” not to a propagating field or material stress–energy component.

Acceleration is generated by adding horizon-motivated terms (
𝐻
2
H
2
,
𝐻
˙
H
˙
) directly to the acceleration equation, not from intrinsic dynamics.

Standard energy–momentum conservation for matter is assumed, with no explicit exchange term accounting for horizon contributions.

Diagnostic Test Outcomes
D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Without Added Dynamics (Null Baseline)

Result: FAIL

Evidence:
The proposal introduces no new propagating degrees of freedom. All added acceleration arises from horizon entropy and temperature assignments. Under conservation-honest accounting, horizon reclassification alone cannot generate sustained negative pressure from standard matter/radiation. The added
𝐻
2
H
2
term is not derived from intrinsic dynamics but imposed via horizon thermodynamic reasoning.

D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability

Result: FAIL

Evidence:
No explicit coarse-graining prescription is specified. The construction is implicitly tied to a particular horizon definition and thermodynamic reinterpretation. Stability under admissible variations (horizon choice, coarse-graining scale, boundary reassignment) is not demonstrated. The acceleration term is therefore sensitive to descriptive choices.

D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance (Anti Goal-Seeking)

Result: FAIL

Evidence:
Standard matter continuity is assumed with no explicit exchange term
𝑄
Q. Horizon-induced pressure contributes to acceleration without a corresponding conservation-accounted energy transfer. The construction effectively introduces acceleration “for free,” without a closed exchange mechanism linking horizon and interior sectors.

D4 — Predictive Wedge Requirement

Result: FAIL

Evidence:
No operationally distinct predictions beyond accelerated expansion are specified. The proposal does not provide a falsifiable wedge separating it from ΛCDM or inflationary dynamics, relying instead on reinterpretation of existing equations.

Failure Registry IDs Triggered

F-01: Entropy-as-driver (entropy treated as causal agent)

F-02: Horizon agency (boundary treated as dynamical source)

F-03: Privileged coarse-graining (implicit horizon-scale dependence)

F-06: Descriptive non-existence (acceleration without dynamical carrier)

What Would Need to Be True to Change the Verdict

All of the following would be required:

A covariant derivation of the additional acceleration terms from a well-defined action or dynamical field.

Explicit localization of the horizon-induced contribution as a conserved effective stress–energy component or a closed exchange sector.

Demonstration that the acceleration survives admissible changes in horizon definition and coarse-graining scale.

A falsifiable predictive wedge distinguishing the proposal from standard ΛCDM/inflation.

Absent these, the proposal remains a descriptive reinterpretation rather than a physical mechanism.
