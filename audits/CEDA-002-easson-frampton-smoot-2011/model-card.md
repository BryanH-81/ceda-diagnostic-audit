Title: Entropic Accelerating Universe
Audit Class: Horizon / Thermodynamic reinterpretation (inflation-adjacent)
Status: Translation complete (pre-diagnostic)

A. Proposal Summary (As Claimed)

The proposal claims that cosmic acceleration can arise from thermodynamic properties assigned to a cosmological horizon, without introducing new matter fields or modifying the gravitational action. By associating entropy and temperature with the Hubble (or apparent) horizon, an effective entropic force is argued to modify cosmological dynamics and produce accelerated expansion.

B. Claimed Mechanism (As Claimed)

Accelerated expansion arises from horizon thermodynamics. Entropy and temperature are assigned to a cosmological horizon, and an entropic force derived from these quantities is argued to contribute an additional term to the cosmological acceleration equation.

Explicit authorial claims:

No inflaton field is introduced

No new propagating degrees of freedom are added

Standard cosmological matter and radiation remain present

Interpretive note (CEDA translation only):
The proposal treats the horizon as the origin of an effective force/pressure influencing expansion, without promoting the horizon to a dynamical field in the action.

C. Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Inventory
Dynamical DOF (explicit)

FRW spacetime metric governed by General Relativity

Standard cosmological matter and radiation components

Non-dynamical / descriptive quantities (invoked)

Cosmological horizon (typically Hubble horizon)

Horizon entropy SH

Horizon temperature 𝑇𝐻

Effective sector introduced

An effective entropic force / pressure term derived from horizon thermodynamics

DOF status:
The entropic sector is not represented by an independent field or stress–energy tensor with its own equation of motion.

D. System–Environment Partition

Interior system: FRW cosmological interior containing matter and radiation

Boundary/environment: Cosmological horizon treated as a thermodynamic screen

Tracing / integration-out procedure: Not specified

Partition evolution: Horizon radius evolves with
𝐻(𝑡)

CEDA note:
The proposal invokes horizon thermodynamic quantities as causally relevant to interior evolution without specifying an explicit system–environment tracing or coarse-grained derivation.

E. Coarse-Graining Prescription

Declared coarse-graining scale: Implicitly the horizon scale

Operational coarse-graining procedure: Not specified

What is traced out: Not specified

Admissible variations of coarse-graining: Not discussed

No explicit renormalization, averaging, or scale-dependence analysis is provided.

F. Effective Stress–Energy / Dynamical Modification

The proposal modifies the cosmological acceleration equation, not the Friedmann energy equation.

These terms are not derived from a covariant action or from an explicit effective stress–energy tensor.

Energy transfer between horizon and matter sectors: Not written explicitly

CEDA note:
The proposal assumes standard conservation for material components while adding horizon-motivated terms directly to the acceleration equation.

H. Location of Acceleration / Negative Pressure

The proposal explicitly computes a negative pressure located on the horizon screen, derived from an entropic force:

This pressure is:

Not attributed to a material fluid

Not associated with a propagating field

Treated as a surface/screen effect tied to horizon thermodynamics

Acceleration arises from inserting this horizon-associated contribution into the cosmological acceleration equation.

I. Stability Hooks (for D2)

Declared invariance under horizon redefinition: Not specified

Sensitivity to choice of horizon (Hubble vs apparent vs event): Not analyzed

Sensitivity to coarse-graining scale: Not analyzed

Declared observables required to remain stable: Not specified

J. Predictive Wedge (As Claimed)

Claimed distinction from ΛCDM + inflation:

Falsifiability conditions:
Not explicitly stated beyond qualitative consistency with cosmic acceleration.
