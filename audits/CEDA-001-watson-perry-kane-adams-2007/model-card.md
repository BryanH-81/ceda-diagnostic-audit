\#\# 1\. Proposal Summary (As Claimed)

The proposal aims to produce an inflationary phase and successful reheating  
\*without introducing a fundamental scalar inflaton field\*. Instead, accelerated  
expansion arises from a sequence of vacuum-energy–dominated phases, during which  
vacuum energy is converted into thermal radiation via a series of transitions  
(“cascading universe”).

In the simplest limit, the model reproduces observables similar to slow-roll  
inflation.

\#\# 2\. Declared Degrees of Freedom

\#\#\# Dynamical  
\- FRW spacetime metric (General Relativity)  
\- Vacuum energy component \\( \\rho\_\\Lambda \\)  
\- Radiation component \\( \\rho\_r \\)

\#\#\# Absent by construction  
\- No fundamental scalar inflaton field  
\- No modified gravity sector

\---

\#\# 3\. System / Environment Partition

\- \*\*System:\*\* Homogeneous, isotropic FRW universe with two fluid components  
\- \*\*Environment:\*\* None specified  
\- \*\*Horizon role:\*\* Kinematic only; no horizon-mediated dynamics are invoked

The model does not introduce an open-system partition or horizon-based exchange.

\#\# 4\. Baseline Conservation Structure (Uncoupled)

The paper begins with standard conservation:

\\\[  
\\nabla\_\\mu T^{\\mu\\nu} \= 0  
\\\]

For the uncoupled two-fluid system:

\\\[  
\\dot{\\rho}\_\\Lambda \= 0, \\quad  
\\dot{\\rho}\_r \= \-4H\\rho\_r  
\\\]

Acceleration occurs when \\( \\rho\_r \\ll \\rho\_\\Lambda \\), yielding a near–de Sitter  
background.

This uncoupled system serves as the pre-transition baseline.

\---

\#\# 5\. Introduced Exchange Mechanism

To implement the “cascading” behavior, the model introduces an explicit  
vacuum → radiation conversion governed by a decay rate \\( \\Gamma \\):

\\\[  
\\dot{\\rho}\_\\Lambda \= \-\\Gamma \\rho\_\\Lambda  
\\\]  
\\\[  
\\dot{\\rho}\_r \= \-4H\\rho\_r \+ \\Gamma \\rho\_\\Lambda  
\\\]

This exchange term controls:  
\- duration of accelerated expansion  
\- exit from inflation  
\- reheating temperature  
\- perturbation evolution

The decay rate \\( \\Gamma \\) is specified phenomenologically.

\---

\#\# 6\. Location of Accelerated Expansion

Accelerated expansion arises from epochs in which:  
\\\[  
\\rho\_\\Lambda \\gg \\rho\_r  
\\\]  
with the persistence of this regime determined by the magnitude of \\( \\Gamma \\).

Negative pressure is carried explicitly by the vacuum energy component.

\---

\#\# 7\. Coarse-Graining and Scale Dependence

No coarse-graining instability or scale-dependent emergence mechanism is claimed.  
Predictions depend explicitly on the decay rate parameter rather than on  
coarse-grained horizon structure.

\---

\#\# 8\. Claims Relevant to Diagnostics

\- Inflation achieved without scalar fields  
\- Reheating achieved via vacuum decay  
\- Perturbation spectra comparable to slow-roll inflation in simple limits

These claims hinge on the exchange term defined above.
