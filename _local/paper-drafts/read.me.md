\# WF1.2 — Null Control Example

This directory contains a \*\*deliberate null control\*\* used to validate the Cosmological Explanation Diagnostic Audit (CEDA).

WF1.2 is not a proposed cosmological model. It is a clean construction designed to test a specific explanatory move:    
\*\*the claim that horizon-mediated accessibility reconfiguration alone can source inflation-like behavior without new dynamics.\*\*

\#\# Why Null Controls Matter

A diagnostic framework that never fails its own examples is not a diagnostic framework — it is advocacy.

WF1.2 is intentionally built to:  
\- Respect standard conservation laws  
\- Avoid hidden dynamical degrees of freedom  
\- Use the horizon only as a bookkeeping boundary  
\- Make all assumptions explicit

This makes it an ideal stress test for CEDA’s core diagnostics, particularly D1 (Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test) and D2 (Coarse-Graining Stability).

\#\# What This Example Demonstrates

\- Inflation-like behavior can appear \*\*purely from repartitioning and reweighting\*\*  
\- Under conservation-honest accounting, this behavior does \*\*not\*\* correspond to physical negative pressure  
\- Horizon redefinition and coarse-graining choice do explanatory work only at the descriptive level

The resulting failure is therefore \*\*structural\*\*, not rhetorical.

\#\# How to Use This Example

If you are applying CEDA to a real proposal:  
1\. Compare your model card to \`model-card.md\` here  
2\. Ask whether your mechanism introduces \*anything WF1.2 does not\*  
3\. If not, expect the same D1/D2 outcome

WF1.2 establishes the baseline:    
\*\*what bookkeeping alone can and cannot explain.\*\*
