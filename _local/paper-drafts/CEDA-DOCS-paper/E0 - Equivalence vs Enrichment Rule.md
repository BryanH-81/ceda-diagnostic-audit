## **E0 — Equivalence vs Enrichment Rule**

**Purpose.**  
 E0 distinguishes legitimate reformulations of a physical model from constructions that introduce *new dynamical structure* under the guise of reinterpretation. This rule applies whenever a proposal claims equivalence to an existing theory or mechanism.

CEDA treats equivalence as a **strong claim** that must be earned.

### **E0.1 Definition of Reformulation (Equivalence)**

A reformulation is classified as **equivalent** *only if all of the following conditions are met*:

1. **Invertibility (or Constrained Auxiliaries)**  
    The mapping between descriptions is invertible, or any auxiliary fields introduced are:

   * algebraically constrained, or

   * fully eliminable without introducing new initial data.

2. **Solution Space Preservation**  
    The reformulation preserves:

   * the dimensionality of the solution space, and

   * the counting of independent initial data.

3. No new freely specifiable functions, profiles, or control parameters may appear.

4. **Conservation Law Identity**  
    All conservation laws (energy–momentum, charges, unitarity where applicable) are:

   * identical in form, and

   * enforced without auxiliary closure conditions.

5. **Causal Structure Preservation**  
    The causal ordering of events and propagation constraints are unchanged.  
    Horizons may be redescribed, but not promoted to dynamical agents.

If **any** of these conditions fail, the reformulation is **not equivalent**.

### **E0.2 Definition of Enrichment**

A reformulation is classified as **enrichment** if it introduces *any* of the following:

* new constitutive relations,

* new effective equations of state,

* new exchange or stabilization terms,

* new freely specifiable functions (even if “slowly varying”),

* new persistence or exit conditions,

* new dynamical roles assigned to descriptive constructs.

Enrichment is not forbidden.  
 It is simply **audited as new structure**, not reinterpretation.

---

### **E0.3 Diagnostic Consequence**

* **Equivalent reformulations** are audited as *the same mechanism* under CEDA.

* **Enrichments** are audited as *distinct models* and subjected to:

  * D1 (null enforcement),

  * D2 (stability),

  * D3 (exchange provenance),

  * D4 (predictive wedge), if novelty is claimed.

Narrative claims of “it’s just a different language” carry **no diagnostic weight**.

## **Worked Example**

### **Allowed Equivalence: f(R)↔f(R) \\leftrightarrowf(R)↔ Scalar–Tensor (Starobinsky)**

* The R+R2R \+ R^2R+R2 action can be rewritten via a Legendre transform into a scalar–tensor theory.

* The scalaron:

  * introduces no new free initial data,

  * has dynamics fully fixed by the original action,

  * preserves conservation laws and causal structure.

* The mapping is invertible (modulo standard boundary conditions).

**CEDA Classification:**  
 ✔ **Equivalent Reformulation**  
 Audited as a single mechanism with intrinsic dynamics.

---

### **Disallowed Equivalence: Horizon Bookkeeping ↔ Emergent Scalar Field**

Typical claim:

“Horizon accessibility can be reinterpreted as an emergent scalar driving inflation.”

Diagnostic findings:

* The “emergent field” introduces:

  * a new effective equation of state,

  * persistence conditions for w≈−1w \\approx \-1w≈−1,

  * implicit stabilization of accessibility weights.

* These elements are not fixed by horizon kinematics alone.

* Initial data counting increases.

* Conservation closure depends on auxiliary assumptions.

**CEDA Classification:**  
 ✘ **Enrichment (New Structure Introduced)**  
 Audited as a new model; equivalence claim rejected.
