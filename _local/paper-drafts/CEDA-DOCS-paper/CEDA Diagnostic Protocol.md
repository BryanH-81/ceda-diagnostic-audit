# **CEDA Diagnostic Protocol**

**(Operational, Framework-Neutral, Conservation-Honest)**

## **Status**

Mandatory procedure for all CEDA audits.  
 Applies to inflationary, non-inflationary, and alternative early-universe proposals.

CEDA evaluates **explanatory structure only**.  
 It does *not* assess empirical fit, likelihood, elegance, or plausibility.

---

## **Run Validity Gate (Non-Negotiable)**

A diagnostic run is valid **only if all conditions below are met**.

### **RG1 — Completed Model Card**

* All required sections (A–J) must be explicitly filled.

* Missing, deferred, or ambiguous entries result in:  
   **Classification: Underspecified**

* No diagnostic test may compensate for incomplete specification.

### **RG2 — Completed A0 Admissibility Declaration**

* Allowed reformulations, coarse-grainings, and equivalence criteria must be declared *before* diagnostics.

* Undeclared freedoms may **not** be invoked later.

### **RG3 — Forbidden Moves Enforcement**

If any forbidden move occurs, the run terminates immediately with:  
 **Classification: Reinterpretation**

Forbidden moves include (non-exhaustive):

* Horizon agency

* Entropy treated as a driver

* Bookkeeping promoted to dynamics

* Hidden slow-roll or control variables

* Post-hoc stabilization or smoothing

* Conservation violations (explicit or implicit)

### **RG4 — Diagnostic Report Required**

Every run must produce a Diagnostic Report documenting:

* Tests executed

* Pass / Fail outcomes

* Evidence cited

* Final classification

### **RG5 — Null Results Are Binding**

Confirmed null results constrain *all* downstream interpretation.  
 No reparameterization, reinterpretation, or narrative reframing is permitted within the same run.

## **Step 1 — Translation into CEDA Primitives**

The model is translated into CEDA’s neutral descriptive language.

The analyst must explicitly identify:

* dynamically accessible degrees of freedom

* traced-out / inaccessible degrees of freedom

* causal domain and boundary definition

* coarse-graining scale(s)

**No physical judgment is made here.**  
 This step is purely representational.

Models that cannot be expressed in these terms are not rejected, but are flagged:  
 **Status: Insufficiently Specified for Diagnostic Analysis**

---

## **Step 2 — System–Environment Partitioning**

The implicit partition structure is made explicit.

For each sector contributing to the effective stress–energy:

* Is the sector treated as closed or open?

* Are exchange terms present?

* If present, how do they arise?

**Critical rule:**  
 Any exchange term must arise *solely* from evolution of the declared partition (e.g., horizon growth, accessibility change, reassignment of modes).

Exchange terms introduced as:

* closure assumptions,

* phenomenological regulators,

* outcome-targeting parameters

are flagged for D3 scrutiny.

---

## **Step 3 — Conservation Accounting Enforcement**

All energy–momentum accounting must be written in explicitly conservative form.

Required:

* sector-by-sector continuity equations

* equal-and-opposite exchange terms

* no net creation or destruction of energy–momentum

If accelerated expansion or negative pressure appears, the analyst must determine whether it arises from:

* intrinsic dynamics of accessible DOF, or

* reclassification of DOF across the partition

Any construction requiring implicit energy injection, horizon-sourced energy, or undefined global accounting **fails immediately**.

---

## **Step 4 — Diagnostic Stress-Test Suite**

With bookkeeping explicit, the model is subjected to mandatory stress tests.

### **D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test**

Tests whether horizon or accessibility changes *alone* generate acceleration.

* No added dynamics permitted.

* No privileged smoothing.

* Exchange terms must be derived.

Failure indicates bookkeeping masquerading as mechanism.

---

### **D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability Test**

Tests robustness under admissible descriptive variation (per A0).

Admissible variations include:

* small horizon shifts

* modest coarse-graining scale changes

* reassignment of near-boundary modes

**Failure criteria:**

* order-unity change in w+1w \+ 1w+1

* loss of acceleration

* emergence of dominant exchange terms

* need for parameter retuning

Failure ⇒ descriptively fragile, not dynamical.

---

### **D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance Test**

Tests whether exchange terms are:

* derived, or

* injected / goal-seeking

Any term that:

* regulates duration,

* controls exit,

* stabilizes behavior,  
   without microphysical derivation fails D3.

---

### **D4 — Predictive Wedge Test**

Applied **only if novelty is claimed**.

Requires:

* an operational difference from ΛCDM \+ inflation

* a falsifiable consequence

* not merely “same outputs, different language”

Failure ⇒ reinterpretation.

---

## **Step 5 — Bookkeeping Dependence Isolation**

The analyst explicitly identifies which features depend on:

* partition choice

* coarse-graining scheme

* accessibility parametrization

If a claimed effect disappears under admissible variation, it is classified as **descriptive**, even if mathematically consistent.

---

## **Step 6 — Diagnostic Classification**

Each model receives **one** classification:

### **Stable Mechanism**

* Introduces genuine new dynamics

* Survives conservation enforcement

* Stable under admissible variation

### **Reinterpretation**

* Reproduces known behavior via descriptive reweighting

* No new dynamics introduced

### **Ambiguous**

* Incomplete specification prevents resolution

* Further formalization required

### **Underspecified**

* Fails Run Validity Gate

This classification is **structural**, not empirical.

---

## **Scope Statement**

CEDA:

* does not rank models

* does not replace inflation or ΛCDM

* does not claim observational authority

CEDA exists to answer one question, cleanly:

**Where does early-universe physics actually introduce dynamics, and where is it only bookkeeping?**
