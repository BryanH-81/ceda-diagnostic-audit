Scope and Non-Claims

### **1\. Status of CEDA**

The Cosmological Explanation Diagnostic Audit (CEDA) is a **diagnostic audit tool**.  
 It is not a physical theory, not a phenomenological model, and not a proposal for the early-universe dynamics.

CEDA does **not** attempt to explain the origin of the universe, derive cosmological evolution, or compete with existing models. Its sole purpose is to **audit explanatory structure** in early-universe proposals by enforcing conservation-honest bookkeeping and a strict separation between dynamics and description.

CEDA evaluates *how* a model explains what it claims to explain, not *whether the universe actually behaved that way*.

---

### **2\. Explicit Non-Claims**

CEDA makes **no claims** about:

* the correctness or incorrectness of inflation,

* the truth of ΛCDM or any alternative framework,

* the physical reality of horizons as agents or mechanisms,

* the existence or non-existence of new degrees of freedom,

* the ontological status of entropy, information, or coarse-graining.

CEDA does **not**:

* replace inflation,

* propose a new early-universe scenario,

* rank theories by truth or plausibility,

* adjudicate empirical adequacy,

* offer predictions or parameter fits.

Any reading of CEDA as a “theory in disguise” is a category error.

---

### **3\. What CEDA Actually Audits**

CEDA audits **explanatory provenance**.

Specifically, it asks:

* Where does negative pressure enter?

* What degrees of freedom are dynamically active?

* What is traced out, averaged over, or reclassified?

* Which effects survive admissible changes in coarse-graining?

* Which effects vanish when privileged bookkeeping is removed?

CEDA is agnostic to the *content* of a proposal. It is sensitive only to the *structure* of its explanation.

A model may pass CEDA and still be empirically wrong.  
 A model may fail CEDA and still fit the data.

These outcomes are not in tension.

---

### **4\. Regime and Admissibility Discipline**

CEDA audits proposals **only within their declared regime of validity**.

It does not:

* extrapolate models beyond where authors claim applicability,

* penalize effective descriptions for not being fundamental,

* require UV completion,

* demand microphysical derivations where none are claimed.

Conversely, CEDA **does require** that within the declared regime:

* conservation laws are explicit,

* exchange terms are accounted for,

* horizons are treated as causal boundaries, not agents,

* coarse-graining choices are not silently promoted to dynamics.

CEDA does not punish incompleteness.  
 It flags **unacknowledged dependence**.

---

### **5\. Diagnostic Outcomes (Not Verdicts)**

CEDA produces **diagnostic classifications**, not judgments of truth.

Possible outcomes include:

* **Pass**  
   The claimed behavior survives conservation enforcement, admissible coarse-graining variation, and provenance tracing.

* **Conditional**  
   The behavior depends on additional structure whose physical status is unresolved or incompletely specified.

* **Scope-Limited**  
   The explanation works only in a narrowly defined regime and does not generalize as claimed.

* **Translation-Sensitive**  
   The behavior appears only under specific descriptive choices or variable redefinitions.

* **Audit-Not-Ready**  
   The proposal cannot be evaluated due to missing or ambiguous bookkeeping.

These classifications are **descriptive**, not evaluative.  
 They do not imply endorsement or rejection.

---

### **6\. Inflation Is Not Privileged**

CEDA does not privilege inflation.

Inflationary models often pass CEDA diagnostics **because they introduce explicit dynamical structure**—not because CEDA is tuned to favor them. When inflationary constructions rely on genuine fields, equations of motion, and conserved stress–energy, they survive coarse-graining variation and exchange-term scrutiny.

If an inflationary model failed these tests, CEDA would flag it accordingly.

CEDA’s criteria are theory-neutral.  
 They are enforced equally on inflationary, non-inflationary, and hybrid proposals.

---

### **7\. What Success Means for CEDA**

CEDA is successful if it:

* prevents descriptive bookkeeping from being mistaken for physics,

* clarifies where negative pressure is earned versus declared,

* exposes hidden assumptions without rhetorical debate,

* provides a shared language for referees, authors, and reviewers.

CEDA does not aim to win cosmology.  
 It aims to make cosmology harder to fool—especially by itself.
