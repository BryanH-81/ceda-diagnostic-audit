**Purpose.**  
 This declaration specifies, in the model’s *own terms*, what constitutes physically equivalent reformulations and admissible descriptive choices. CEDA uses this declaration to evaluate symmetry preservation, conservation discipline, causal structure, and well-posed evolution **without imposing a preferred ontology or formalism**.

Failure to complete this declaration results in an **Underspecified** classification.

---

### **A0.1 Framework Ontology**

Describe the fundamental descriptive level of the model.

* ☐ Continuum EFT

* ☐ Discrete / lattice

* ☐ Holographic / dual

* ☐ Nonlocal / integral kernel

* ☐ Hybrid (specify): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

State explicitly whether spacetime geometry, degrees of freedom, and interactions are treated as:

* fundamental

* emergent

* dual descriptions

---

### **A0.2 Allowed Reformulations**

List transformations that are declared to represent **the same physics**, not merely the same outcomes.

Examples (check all that apply and specify limits):

* ☐ Field redefinitions

* ☐ Frame changes (e.g., Jordan ↔ Einstein)

* ☐ Duality maps (specify which)

* ☐ Change of variables / canonical transformations

* ☐ Gauge choices

* ☐ Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Equivalence criterion:**  
 State what must remain invariant under these reformulations (e.g., observables, spectra, causal structure, conserved charges).

---

### **A0.3 Allowed Coarse-Grainings**

Specify admissible coarse-graining operations.

* Coarse-graining scale(s): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* What is traced out / averaged over: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* What must remain fixed under coarse-graining: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Clarify whether coarse-graining is:

* ☐ physical (dictated by causal structure / dynamics)

* ☐ descriptive (multiple equivalent choices allowed)

---

### **A0.4 Physical Equivalence Standard**

Define explicitly what counts as *“same physics”* in this framework.

Examples:

* identical background evolution

* identical perturbation spectra

* identical causal ordering

* identical conserved quantities

* other invariants: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

CEDA will treat any change violating this declared standard as **physically distinct**, not merely reformulated.

---

### **A0.5 Symmetry Commitments**

List symmetries the model claims to preserve:

* ☐ Diffeomorphism invariance

* ☐ Lorentz invariance (local / emergent / broken)

* ☐ Gauge symmetries (specify): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* ☐ Discrete symmetries: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

State whether any symmetry is approximate, emergent, or scale-dependent.

---

### **A0.6 Conservation Commitments**

Declare conservation laws that must hold under all admissible reformulations and coarse-grainings:

* ☐ Energy–momentum conservation

* ☐ Probability / unitarity

* ☐ Charge conservation

* ☐ Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If conservation is emergent or effective, specify the regime of validity.

---

### **A0.7 Causal Structure**

Define how causal relations are treated:

* ☐ Local light-cone causality

* ☐ Emergent causal ordering

* ☐ Nonlocal but causal (specify kernel/structure)

* ☐ Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Clarify whether horizons are:

* boundaries only

* dynamical entities

* bookkeeping constructs

---

### **A0.8 Well-Posed Evolution**

State what constitutes a well-posed model evolution:

* initial data requirements

* evolution equations or rules

* criteria for breakdown or regime exit

CEDA will not supply missing closure conditions.

---

### **A0.9 Explicit Non-Equivalences**

List transformations or reformulations that **do not** count as the same physics in this framework.

Example:

* changing coarse-graining scale beyond X

* switching horizon definition

* introducing auxiliary smoothing

* reparameterizing time or scale factor

---

### **A0.10 Admissibility Acknowledgment**

By completing this declaration, the authors acknowledge:

* CEDA will **only** judge the model within these declared admissibility boundaries.

* Effects that disappear under declared admissible variations are classified as **descriptive**, not dynamical.

* Undeclared freedoms may not be invoked post-diagnostic.
