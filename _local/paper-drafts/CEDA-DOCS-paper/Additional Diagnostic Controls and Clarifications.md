# Additional Diagnostic Controls and Clarifications

## **A. C1 — Coupling Provenance & Redundancy Test**

*(Closes the “f(R, φ)” and EFT camouflage loophole)*

### **Purpose**

Diagnostic C1 determines whether apparent dynamical structure introduced at the **coupling or operator level** represents genuine new physical content, or whether it merely re-encodes an arbitrary time-dependent equation of state or background control function under a different mathematical guise.

This test exists because models can evade sector-level diagnostics by shifting freedom into couplings, counterterms, or functional dependence—while leaving the explanatory content unchanged.

---

### **Diagnostic C1 — Definition**

**C1 (Coupling Provenance & Redundancy Test)**  
 A proposed early-universe mechanism passes C1 if and only if all effective couplings or operator-level structures that influence expansion or stress–energy sourcing satisfy *simultaneously*:

1. **Operator Control**

   * The coupling structure is supported by a well-defined EFT expansion:

     * operators are organized by dimension,

     * truncation is justified within the declared regime,

     * higher-order terms are parametrically suppressed.

   * No operator is promoted to leading-order relevance without justification independent of the desired cosmological behavior.

2. **Functional Degree-of-Freedom Accounting**

   * The number of freely specifiable functions introduced by the coupling structure is explicitly counted.

   * If the coupling introduces an arbitrary function of time, scale factor, curvature invariant, or horizon size, it is treated as an *effective control function*, regardless of notation.

   * Reparameterizations that preserve functional freedom (e.g. redefining w(t)w(t)w(t) as f(R)f(R)f(R) evaluated on-shell) are not counted as new structure.

3. **Predictive Compression**

   * The introduction of the coupling must *reduce* the space of admissible cosmological histories relative to a free equation-of-state parameterization.

   * At least one nontrivial constraint, inequality, or excluded behavior must follow from the coupling that was not already excluded by conservation and background dynamics alone.

---

### **Pass / Fail Criteria**

**Pass (C1-Satisfied)**

* Couplings are EFT-controlled,

* functional freedom is reduced relative to a free w(t)w(t)w(t), and

* new constraints survive reparameterization and coarse-graining.

**Fail (C1-Violated)**  
 Any of the following:

* coupling functions are effectively arbitrary,

* EFT hierarchy is absent or violated,

* predictive content is unchanged under field or variable redefinition.

**Interpretation**  
 Failure of C1 does **not** imply the model is wrong.  
 It implies the model has **not introduced new explanatory structure** and is therefore diagnostic-equivalent to a tuned equation of state.

## **B. S1 — Scheme / State Dependence Classification**

*(Names the disagreement instead of litigating it)*

### **Purpose**

S1 classifies *how* a claimed physical effect depends on choices of renormalization, state, slicing, or coarse-graining—without declaring the effect invalid by default.

This prevents unproductive disputes where “it’s just scheme choice” is treated as a refutation rather than a characterization.

---

### **S1 — Dependence Classification Table**

| Class | Label | Definition | Implication for Claims |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| S1-A | Counterterm-Equivalent | Effect can be absorbed into local counterterms or parameter renormalization without changing physical predictions | No new physics; descriptive redundancy |
| S1-B | State-Conditional but Physical | Effect depends on a specific quantum state but survives admissible coarse-graining and respects conservation | Physically meaningful within stated state |
| S1-C | Observer / Slicing Contingent | Effect appears only under particular foliations, coordinates, or observer constructions | Not covariant; limited interpretive scope |
| S1-D | Scheme-Fragile | Effect disappears or changes at order unity under admissible renormalization or partition choices | Descriptively unstable |

---

### **Usage Rule**

* S1 is **not a verdict**.

* It is a **label** that constrains what the effect may legitimately be used to argue.

* Effects tagged S1-B may ground mechanisms.

* Effects tagged S1-A or S1-D may still be useful—but only as effective descriptions, not drivers.

## **C. WF1.2 Scope Correction**

*(Prevents overclaiming and keeps the door open—narrowly)*

### **Motivation**

WF1.2 established a decisive null result **within a specific admissibility class**, but that class was not previously split explicitly. This allowed critics to misinterpret the result as ruling out *all* horizon-related quantum mechanisms.

That is not what WF1.2 did.

This correction tightens the claim and strengthens the framework.

---

### **Revised Structure: WF1.2a / WF1.2b**

#### **WF1.2a — Classical / Semiclassical Partition Bookkeeping Null**

**Assumptions**

* Degrees of freedom dilute according to intrinsic classical or semiclassical equations of state.

* Exchange terms arise *only* from explicit system–environment repartitioning.

* No influence functionals, memory kernels, or nonlocal entanglement dynamics are introduced.

**Null Result**  
 Horizon-mediated repartitioning of radiation-like or matter-like degrees of freedom does **not** generically produce:

* vacuum-like equations of state,

* sustained accelerated expansion,

* or effective negative pressure.

This null is **closed and definitive** under these assumptions.

---

#### **WF1.2b — Quantum Open-System Baseline (Unresolved)**

**Assumptions**

* Interior degrees of freedom are treated as an open quantum system.

* Environmental tracing may introduce:

  * non-Markovian effects,

  * state-dependent influence functionals,

  * entanglement-induced stress–energy corrections.

* Conservation laws remain explicit and global.

**Status**

* No positive mechanism is claimed.

* No horizon agency is conceded.

* The admissible question is narrowed to:

   whether genuinely quantum open-system effects can introduce *new, constrained* structure not reducible to tuned control functions.

**Diagnostic Rule**  
 Any proposal operating in WF1.2b **must still pass**:

* C1 (Coupling Provenance),

* D1/D2 (bookkeeping vs dynamics),

* S1 classification.

No exemptions.

---

### **Corrected Claim Boundary**

WF1.2 rules out horizon reconfiguration as a sufficient mechanism **at the classical and semiclassical bookkeeping level**.  
 It does not adjudicate all possible quantum open-system effects—but it sharply constrains how such effects must be introduced to count as physics rather than relabeling.
