# A Diagnostic Framework for Early-Universe Cosmology

**Status:** External Review Draft  
**Classification:** Conceptual diagnostic framework (not a theory; not a model)

## **Abstract**

The Cosmological Explanation Diagnostic Audit (CEDA) is a framework for auditing explanatory structure in early-universe cosmology. It does not propose new dynamics, modify known laws, or compete with inflationary cosmology. Its sole purpose is to distinguish genuine physical mechanisms from descriptive bookkeeping in models that invoke horizons, entropy, coarse-graining, or effective stress–energy to explain early accelerated expansion.

CEDA originated from an investigation into whether horizon-mediated reconfiguration of dynamically accessible degrees of freedom could, by itself, generate inflation-like expansion. A sequence of internal stress tests—culminating in a strictly conservation-honest diagnostic (WF1.2)—demonstrated that, under conservative classical and semiclassical assumptions, horizon reconfiguration alone does **not** generically produce vacuum-like equations of state or accelerated expansion. This decisive null result motivates a reformulation of the framework as a diagnostic audit tool rather than a candidate mechanism.

CEDA formalizes a set of bookkeeping-honest diagnostics that enforce explicit conservation accounting, coarse-graining stability, and provenance tracing of negative pressure. The framework is theory-neutral and applies equally to inflationary, non-inflationary, and hybrid proposals. Its value lies not in producing cosmological behavior, but in clarifying where such behavior is dynamically earned versus descriptively reweighted.

## **1\. Framework Status and Intent**

CEDA is **not**:

* a cosmological theory,

* a phenomenological model,

* an alternative to inflation,

* a proposal for early-universe dynamics.

CEDA is a **diagnostic audit instrument**.

It evaluates *how* a model explains what it claims to explain—not whether the universe actually behaved that way. A model may pass CEDA and still be empirically wrong; a model may fail CEDA and still fit observational data. These outcomes are not in tension.

CEDA emerged from the Horizon-Enabled Expansion Framework (HEEF). Following decisive null results, all mechanism-seeking claims have been retired. The surviving structure is explicitly diagnostic and is presented here as CEDA v1.2.

## **2\. Core Diagnostic Commitments**

CEDA enforces four non-negotiable commitments:

1. **Conservation Discipline**  
    All energy–momentum accounting must be explicit and globally conserved. Apparent sources of negative pressure must be traceable to intrinsic dynamics or partition bookkeeping—never to horizon agency.

2. **Causal Non-Agency of Horizons**  
    Horizons are causal boundaries that regulate interaction and accessibility. They are not physical agents, sources of energy, or drivers of expansion.

3. **Mandatory Coarse-Graining**  
    Interior effective descriptions necessarily involve tracing out inaccessible degrees of freedom. Coarse-graining is not optional, epistemic, or a modeling convenience—it is enforced by causal structure.

4. **Stability Under Admissible Repartitioning**  
    A genuine mechanism must survive admissible variations in coarse-graining, horizon definition, and system–environment partitioning. Behavior that collapses under such variation is descriptive, not dynamical.

## **3\. Conceptual Primitives**

### **3.1 Horizons**

A horizon is a causal boundary that limits interaction, correlation, and dynamical participation. Degrees of freedom beyond a horizon may exist globally but do not contribute directly to an interior effective description except through boundary bookkeeping.

### **3.2 State Accessibility**

State accessibility denotes which degrees of freedom are dynamically permitted to participate in evolution within a causal region. Accessibility is distinct from entropy, thermalization, or existence.

### **3.3 Constraint Layers**

Effective descriptions are constrained simultaneously by geometry, causality, conservation laws, quantum structure, and horizon-defined accessibility. Failure occurs at the *descriptive* level when no stable coarse-grained interior description exists.

---

## **4\. Interior Effective Descriptions and Stability**

An interior effective description is defined by:

* a causal domain,

* a system–environment partition,

* a coarse-graining prescription.

**Stability Criterion:**  
 An effective description is stable if physically relevant observables (⟨Tμν⟩, equation of state, geometric evolution) remain approximately invariant under admissible variations in:

* horizon placement,

* coarse-graining scale,

* assignment of near-boundary degrees of freedom.

Order-unity sensitivity signals descriptive failure—not a breakdown of GR or quantum mechanics.

---

## **5\. Horizon Reconfiguration Events (HREs)**

Within CEDA, an HRE is **not** a physical mechanism.

An HRE denotes the failure of a prior interior effective description under coarse-graining stability tests, necessitating a redefinition of causal bookkeeping. No energy is created, destroyed, or injected. Geometry responds only to the reorganized effective stress–energy through standard Einstein dynamics.

CEDA explicitly does **not** claim that HREs generically produce:

* inflation,

* vacuum-like equations of state,

* accelerated expansion.

---

## **6\. Diagnostic Architecture**

### **6.1 Diagnostic Test D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null**

**Result (Canonical):**  
 Horizon-mediated repartitioning of radiation- or matter-like degrees of freedom does **not** generically produce vacuum-like behavior under conservation-honest bookkeeping.

This null result is closed and definitive within its admissibility class.

### **6.2 Diagnostic Test D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability**

Tests whether claimed dynamics survive admissible repartitioning without retuning. Failure indicates dependence on privileged bookkeeping.

### **6.3 Coupling Provenance & Redundancy Test (C1)**

Evaluates whether coupling-level structure introduces genuine new degrees of freedom or merely re-encodes an arbitrary equation of state under different notation.

### **6.4 Scheme / State Dependence Classification (S1)**

Classifies effects as:

* counterterm-equivalent,

* state-conditional but physical,

* observer/slicing contingent,

* scheme-fragile.

S1 is a classification, not a verdict.

## **7\. WF1.2 Scope Correction**

CEDA v1.2 explicitly distinguishes:

**WF1.2a — Classical/Semiclassical Bookkeeping Null (Closed)**  
 Horizon reconfiguration does not generate inflation under conservative assumptions.

**WF1.2b — Quantum Open-System Baseline (Open, Constrained)**  
 Non-Markovian or entanglement-induced effects are not ruled out *in principle*, but must still pass D1/D2, C1, and S1. No horizon agency or control-function smuggling is permitted.

No positive mechanism is claimed in WF1.2b.

---

## **8\. Diagnostic Application Protocol**

CEDA audits models via a fixed protocol:

1. Translate into accessibility and partition language

2. Make system–environment exchange explicit

3. Enforce conservation accounting

4. Apply D1/D2/C1/S1 diagnostics

5. Identify bookkeeping-dependent behavior

6. Assign diagnostic classification (mechanism / reinterpretation / ambiguous)

These classifications are descriptive, not evaluative.

---

## **9\. Relationship to Inflation**

CEDA does not privilege inflation.

Inflationary models often pass diagnostics because they introduce explicit dynamical structure. When inflationary behavior survives coarse-graining variation and conservation enforcement, it is correctly classified as a genuine mechanism.

CEDA sharpens—not challenges—the explanatory boundary inflation occupies.

---

## **10\. Conclusion**

CEDA reframes early-universe inquiry around a single demand:

**Where does cosmological behavior come from—dynamics or description?**

The framework’s success is not measured by producing expansion, but by preventing descriptive bookkeeping from being mistaken for physics. CEDA does not aim to replace cosmology. It aims to make cosmology harder to fool—especially by itself.
