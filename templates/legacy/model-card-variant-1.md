\#\# 1\. Proposal Summary (As Claimed)

The proposal claims that cosmic acceleration can arise from the thermodynamic  
properties of the cosmological horizon. By associating entropy and temperature  
with the Hubble horizon, an effective entropic force is argued to modify the  
Friedmann equations, producing accelerated expansion without introducing  
new matter fields or modifying gravity.

\#\# 2\. Declared Degrees of Freedom

\#\#\# Dynamical  
\- FRW spacetime metric (General Relativity)  
\- Standard cosmological matter and radiation components

\#\#\# Non-dynamical (as stated)  
\- Cosmological horizon  
\- Horizon entropy and temperature

No additional fields or fluids are introduced.

\---

\#\# 3\. Role of Horizons

The Hubble horizon is assigned thermodynamic properties (entropy, temperature)  
and is treated as the origin of an effective entropic force that influences  
cosmic expansion.

The horizon is not introduced as a dynamical degree of freedom in the action.

\---

\#\# 4\. Conservation Structure

Energy–momentum conservation is formally maintained via modified Friedmann  
equations. No explicit energy exchange terms between matter and horizon degrees  
of freedom are introduced.

\---

\#\# 5\. Location of Accelerated Expansion

Accelerated expansion is attributed to horizon-induced entropic effects,  
manifesting as additional terms in the cosmological equations.

Negative pressure is not localized to a material component.

\---

\#\# 6\. Coarse-Graining and Description Level

The proposal relies on thermodynamic reinterpretation at the horizon scale.  
No explicit coarse-graining instability or scale-dependent transition is claimed.

\---

\#\# 7\. Claims Relevant to Diagnostics

\- Inflation-like or late-time acceleration without new fields  
\- Horizon thermodynamics as a physical driver  
\- Compatibility with standard cosmological components
