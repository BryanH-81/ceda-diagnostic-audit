# D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability Test
## Target
Proposals whose claims depend on a privileged smoothing scale, horizon definition, or coarse-graining choice.

## Pass Condition
Key observables and the qualitative mechanism remain stable under admissible variations in coarse-graining/horizon definition.

## Fail Signatures
- Mechanism disappears or flips sign under reasonable coarse-graining changes
- Stability asserted without demonstration
