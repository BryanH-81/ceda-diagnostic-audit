# D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance Test
## Target
Q-like exchange terms between partitions, especially those introduced as “effective” flows.

## Pass Condition
Exchange term is derived from declared dynamics/partitioning and respects conservation identities.

## Fail Signatures
- Q is inserted to close equations
- Q depends on horizon choice without microphysical derivation
