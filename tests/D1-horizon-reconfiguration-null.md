# D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test

## Purpose

To test claims that inflation-like accelerated expansion arises from
**horizon-mediated accessibility changes, repartitioning, or reweighting**
_without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom._

D1 enforces the separation between **causal structure** and **dynamical agency**.

---

## Target Class

- Horizon-driven EFT reinterpretations
- Entanglement / accessibility-based explanations
- Models where expansion appears after redefining what is “inside” the horizon

---

## Test Procedure

1. Hold fixed:

   - Declared dynamical DOF
   - Action / equations of motion
   - Conservation laws

2. Allow:

   - Horizon redefinition
   - Repartitioning of system vs environment
   - Reclassification of accessible vs inaccessible modes

3. Examine whether:
   - Negative pressure appears _only after_ reclassification
   - Effective stress–energy is altered without new dynamics

---

## Pass Condition

The proposal identifies a **physical source of negative pressure**
that survives horizon redefinition and does not rely on repartitioning
as a causal agent.

---

## Fail Signatures

- Horizon treated as an agent rather than a boundary
- Acceleration appears only after bookkeeping changes
- Effective vacuum-like stress–energy introduced without provenance
- “Accessibility” language substitutes for dynamics

---

## Notes

A D1 failure does **not** falsify the model.
It demonstrates that the claimed mechanism is _descriptive_, not dynamical.
