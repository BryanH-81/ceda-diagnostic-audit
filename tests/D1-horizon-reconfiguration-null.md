# D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test
## Target
Claims where accelerated expansion emerges from horizon-mediated accessibility / repartitioning without new dynamical DOF.

## Pass Condition
The proposal identifies where negative pressure physically lives (action-level or explicit DOF) and shows conservation-honest sourcing.

## Fail Signatures
- Horizon treated as causal agent
- Effective stress–energy introduced without provenance
- Negative pressure appears only after bookkeeping repartitioning
