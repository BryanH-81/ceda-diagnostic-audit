# D4 — Mechanism Audit (Inflation-in-Disguise)
## Target
Constructions that reproduce inflationary behavior while claiming not to introduce inflationary structure.

## Pass Condition
New structure is explicit, non-teleological, and not equivalent to an inflaton/slow-roll mechanism under reparameterization.

## Fail Signatures
- Hidden scalar/clock appears in EFT clothing
- “Geometric/entropic” language substitutes for dynamics
- Retrospective tuning after failures appear
