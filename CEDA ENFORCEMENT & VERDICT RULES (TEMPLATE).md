**Status:** Binding  
 **Scope:** All CEDA diagnostic runs  
 **Applies to:** Model Declarations, Diagnostic Reports, Audits

---

## **1\. Jurisdiction & Ontological Scope**

CEDA applies **only** to models that:

* treat spacetime as a differentiable manifold,

* obey local energy–momentum conservation,

* operate within semiclassical GR / EFT-style dynamics,

* treat horizons as causal boundaries, not agents.

CEDA is **not neutral across ontologies**.  
 Models outside this scope are classified as **Out of Jurisdiction**, not failed.

---

## **2\. Run Validity Gate (Non-Negotiable)**

A diagnostic run is **invalid** unless all are satisfied:

* Degrees of freedom explicitly declared

* System–environment partition specified

* Conservation structure identifiable

* Horizon role explicitly stated

* No forbidden moves invoked at setup

If any condition fails:

* the run terminates,

* no diagnostic result is recorded,

* no verdict may be assigned.

Invalid runs may not be cited.

---

## **3\. Forbidden Moves (Immediate Failure)**

The following moves are **category errors**, not fixable deficiencies.

Invoking any results in automatic classification as **Reinterpretation**, regardless of diagnostics.

### **F-01 — Horizon Agency**

Treating horizons as:

* sources of energy,

* drivers of expansion,

* causal agents.

Horizons may regulate participation. Nothing more.

---

### **F-02 — Entropy as a Driver**

Using entropy, information, or complexity as a **force**, pressure, or engine.

Entropy may describe states. It does not move geometry.

---

### **F-03 — Bookkeeping → Dynamics Conflation**

Treating:

* coarse-graining choices,

* partition definitions,

* averaging schemes

as physical causes rather than descriptive structure.

---

### **F-04 — Hidden Exchange Injection**

Introducing exchange terms:

* without derivation from partition evolution,

* without microphysical justification,

* or as closure assumptions.

---

### **F-05 — Inflation-in-Disguise**

Reintroducing inflationary control variables under alternative labels  
 (e.g. decay rates, accessibility functions, smoothing kernels).

Relabeling ≠ mechanism.

---

### **F-06 — Privileged Description**

Stabilizing behavior by:

* fixing a special slicing,

* freezing a horizon definition,

* tuning a coarse-graining scale.

Real physics survives reformulation.

---

### **F-07 — Post-Hoc Rescue**

Adjusting:

* parameters,

* interpretations,

* scope

**after** a diagnostic failure.

Nulls bind. Excuses don’t.

---

### **F-08 — Retroactive Scope Narrowing**

Redefining what the model “really claimed” after diagnostics are applied.

Claims are fixed at declaration.

---

## **4\. Null Result Binding Rule**

A confirmed null diagnostic (e.g. D1 or D2):

* constrains all downstream interpretation,

* may not be bypassed by reframing,

* may not be softened by “in principle” arguments.

A new claim requires a **new Model Declaration**.

---

## **5\. Diagnostic Independence Rule**

Each diagnostic (D1–D4):

* is evaluated independently,

* may not be compensated by passing others,

* may not be weighted or averaged.

One structural failure is sufficient.

---

## **6\. Ambiguity & Branching Rule**

If a model admits **multiple physically admissible translations** that could alter outcomes:

* each translation requires a separate audit branch,

* results may not be averaged,

* disagreement defaults to **Ambiguous**, not Mechanism.

Uncertainty penalizes claims, not diagnostics.

---

## **7\. Verdict Taxonomy (Exhaustive)**

Exactly one verdict must be assigned.

### **Mechanism**

* Introduces genuine new dynamical structure

* Survives conservation enforcement

* Stable under coarse-graining variation

---

### **Reinterpretation**

* Reproduces known behavior via descriptive reweighting

* No new dynamics introduced

* Often passes equations, fails provenance

---

### **Inflation in Disguise**

* Dynamically equivalent to inflation

* Control variables relocated, not eliminated

---

### **Structurally Unstable**

* Behavior collapses under admissible variation

* Depends on privileged bookkeeping

---

### **Underspecified / Ambiguous**

* Incomplete declaration

* Multiple inequivalent interpretations

* Diagnostics not convergent

---

### **Out of Jurisdiction**

* Violates CEDA’s ontological scope

* Uses nonlocal, agentic, or non-dynamical primitives

---

## **8\. Verdict Finality Rule**

A verdict applies **only** to:

* the declared model,

* the declared regime,

* the declared assumptions.

Changing any of these requires a **new audit**.

---

## **9\. Precedence Rule**

In case of conflict:

1. **ENFORCEMENT.md**

2. Diagnostic definitions (D1–D4)

3. Model Declaration

4. Diagnostic Report

5. Narrative documents / papers

Lower layers may not override higher ones.

---

## **10\. Non-Claims (Explicit)**

CEDA does **not**:

* rank models by plausibility,

* assess observational fit,

* propose new cosmological mechanisms,

* claim inflation is wrong or unnecessary.

CEDA determines **where explanatory credit is earned**.

---

### **Final Note**

CEDA is not generous.  
 It is not charitable.  
 It is not impressed by clever language.

It exists to answer one question, cleanly and repeatably:

*Where does the physics actually live?*
