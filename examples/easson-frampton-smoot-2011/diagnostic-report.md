## Run Validity Gate

**Status:** PASS

- Declared degrees of freedom are explicit (FRW geometry + standard matter).
- No hidden scalar fields or modified gravity sector are introduced.
- No explicit exchange terms or decay parameters appear.
- Conservation of energy–momentum is asserted at the equation level.

The proposal is eligible for full CEDA diagnostics.

## Diagnostic Results

### D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test

**Result:** **FAIL**

**Test:**  
Treat the cosmological horizon strictly as a _descriptive boundary_ with no
causal agency or independent degrees of freedom. Remove any attribution of
force, work, or dynamical influence to horizon entropy or temperature.

**Observation:**  
When horizon agency is removed, the additional acceleration terms attributed
to entropic effects no longer have a physical source. No stress–energy tensor,
field, fluid, or conserved exchange remains to support accelerated expansion.

The claimed acceleration depends entirely on interpreting geometric quantities
(\(H\), \(\dot H\)) as forces arising from horizon thermodynamics rather than as
descriptive features of the spacetime solution.

**Conclusion:**  
Accelerated expansion does **not** survive the null operation. The horizon is
being promoted from a descriptive boundary to a causal agent without
corresponding dynamical degrees of freedom or conservation accounting.

This constitutes a **D1 failure: Horizon Agency**.

### D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability

**Result:** FLAGGED (Subsidiary)

The proposal relies on a privileged thermodynamic description at the horizon
scale. No argument is provided that the acceleration is invariant under
admissible changes in coarse-graining or entropy assignment.

While not the primary failure mode, this reinforces the D1 result.

---

### D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance

**Result:** PASS

No explicit energy exchange terms, decay rates, or source functions are
introduced. The failure mode is not hidden dynamics but misattributed agency.

---

### D4 — Mechanism Audit (Equivalence)

**Result:** FLAGGED

The modified acceleration equation effectively reparameterizes the cosmological
equation of state without introducing new physical degrees of freedom. The
construction is dynamically equivalent to imposing an effective negative
pressure by reinterpretation rather than by mechanism.

---

## Conservation Accounting

The proposal does not specify a work term, energy reservoir, or compensating
ledger associated with the horizon. If the horizon performs work on the universe,
that work is not recorded in any conservation equation.

To preserve conservation, the horizon must be non-dynamical, in which case no
physical work is performed.

## Final Verdict

**CEDA Classification:**  
**D1 Failure — Horizon Agency**

**Secondary Flags:**

- **F-01:** Entropy as Driver
- **D4:** Mechanism Equivalence (reinterpretation)

The proposal attributes causal efficacy to a descriptive boundary (the
cosmological horizon). Once horizon agency is removed, the mechanism does not
produce accelerated expansion.

**Audit Status:** Closed.
