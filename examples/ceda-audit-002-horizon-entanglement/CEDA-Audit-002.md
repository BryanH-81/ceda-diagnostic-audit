\# CEDA-Audit-002



\*\*Audit Class:\*\* Horizon / Entanglement–Driven Inflation  

\*\*Status:\*\* Open



This audit targets proposals in which inflationary expansion is attributed

to horizon structure, entanglement entropy, or thermodynamic reinterpretation

without explicit dynamical exchange terms.



The goal is to determine whether such proposals introduce causal agency

via descriptive bookkeeping.
