# Watson, Perry, Kane & Adams (2007) — Audit in Progress

**Paper:** _Inflation without Inflaton(s)_  
**arXiv:** hep-th/0610054  
**Journal:** JCAP 0711:017 (2007)

This directory contains the Cosmological Explanation Diagnostic Audit (CEDA)
run for the proposal by Watson, Perry, Kane, and Adams claiming inflation-like
behavior without introducing a fundamental inflaton field.

---

## Why This Paper Was Selected

This work sits directly on a key diagnostic fault line targeted by CEDA:

- It explicitly claims **inflation without a fundamental scalar field**
- Accelerated expansion is attributed to a **sequence of vacuum-energy transitions**
- Reheating is achieved via **vacuum → radiation conversion**
- In the simplest case, the perturbation spectrum is claimed to resemble slow-roll inflation

This makes the proposal an ideal candidate for testing **exchange-term provenance**
and **mechanism equivalence**, rather than horizon bookkeeping.

## Audit Status

**Current phase:** Abstract-level + structure identification  
**Primary diagnostic:** D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance  
**Secondary diagnostics:** D2 (Coarse-Graining Stability), D4 (Mechanism Audit)

The current model card and diagnostic report are based on claims visible at the
abstract and structural level. A full audit requires equation-level extraction
from the PDF.

## Files in This Directory

- `model-card.md`  
  Declares the mechanism, degrees of freedom, and structural assumptions as stated
  by the authors prior to diagnostics.

- `diagnostic-report.md`  
  Records preliminary outcomes and identifies which diagnostics are decisive once
  the explicit transition dynamics are specified.

## Key Questions Driving the Audit

1. **Where does negative pressure physically live?**
2. **How is vacuum energy converted to radiation?** (derived vs inserted)
3. **Does the cascade reduce to known inflationary constructions** under reparameterization?
4. **Are predictions stable under admissible coarse-graining?**

---

## Next Steps

1. Extract the exact equations governing vacuum-energy transitions and radiation production
2. Run **D3 (Exchange-Term Provenance)** at equation level
3. Evaluate **D2 (Coarse-Graining Stability)** once scales are identified
4. Run **D4 (Mechanism Audit)** if equivalence to known inflationary dynamics is suspected
