# Watson, Perry, Kane & Adams (2007)

**Paper:** _Inflation without Inflaton(s)_  
**arXiv:** hep-th/0610054  
**Journal:** JCAP 0711:017 (2007)

This directory contains the Cosmological Explanation Diagnostic Audit (CEDA)
run for the proposal by Watson, Perry, Kane, and Adams claiming inflation-like
behavior without introducing a fundamental inflaton field.

## Why This Paper Was Selected

This work sits directly on a key diagnostic fault line targeted by CEDA:

- It explicitly claims **inflation without a fundamental scalar field**
- Accelerated expansion is attributed to a **sequence of vacuum-energy transitions**
- Reheating is achieved via **vacuum → radiation conversion**
- In the simplest case, the perturbation spectrum is claimed to resemble slow-roll inflation

This makes the proposal an ideal candidate for testing **exchange-term provenance**
and **mechanism equivalence**, rather than horizon bookkeeping.

## Audit Status

**Current phase:** Abstract-level + structure identification  
**Primary diagnostic:** D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance  
**Secondary diagnostics:** D2 (Coarse-Graining Stability), D4 (Mechanism Audit)

The current model card and diagnostic report are based on claims visible at the
abstract and structural level. A full audit requires equation-level extraction
from the PDF.

  Declares the mechanism, degrees of freedom, and structural assumptions as stated
  by the authors prior to diagnostics.

- `diagnostic-report.md`  
  Records the full CEDA diagnostic evaluation, including D1–D4 outcomes and the
  final verdict.

- `CEDA-Audit-001.md`  
  Authoritative audit log for this proposal, summarizing the diagnostic findings,
  classification, and rationale. This file is the canonical record for
  **CEDA-Audit-001**.

## Key Questions Driving the Audit

1. **Where does negative pressure physically live?**
2. **How is vacuum energy converted to radiation?** (derived vs inserted)
3. **Does the cascade reduce to known inflationary constructions** under reparameterization?
4. **Are predictions stable under admissible coarse-graining?**
