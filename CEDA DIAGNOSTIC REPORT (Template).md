**Audit ID:** CED-\_\_\_  
 **Paper / Proposal:**  
 **Source:**  
 **Date of Run:**  
 **Auditor:**  
 **Model Declaration Used:** `MODEL-DECLARATION.md` (hash / version)

## **0\. Run Validity & Admissibility Gate (MANDATORY)**

All boxes must be checked **before diagnostics are binding**.

☐ Degrees of freedom explicitly declared  
 ☐ System–environment partition specified  
 ☐ Conservation structure identifiable  
 ☐ No forbidden moves invoked at setup  
 ☐ Ontological jurisdiction compatible (GR / EFT / local dynamics)

**Run Status:**  
 ☐ VALID → proceed  
 ☐ INVALID → terminate audit

If INVALID, state reason briefly and stop here.

---

## **1\. Diagnostic Scope**

**Claimed regime audited:**

(e.g. early accelerated phase only; background dynamics only; perturbations excluded)

**Explicit exclusions:**

(what this audit does *not* evaluate)

This prevents scope creep and retroactive defenses.

## **2\. Diagnostic Results Summary (At-a-Glance)**

| Test | Name | Result |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| D1 | Horizon Reconfiguration Null | ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL ☐ N/A |
| D2 | Coarse-Graining Stability | ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL ☐ N/A |
| D3 | Exchange-Term Provenance | ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL ☐ N/A |
| D4 | Mechanism Audit | ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL ☐ N/A |

☐ Null results are binding  
 ☐ No post-hoc parameter rescue applied

---

## **3\. Diagnostic D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null**

**Question:**  
 Does accelerated expansion persist when horizons are treated strictly as causal boundaries with no agency?

**Test applied:**

(brief description of horizon handling)

**Evidence examined:**

* equations / sections / assumptions

**Result:**  
 ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL ☐ NOT APPLICABLE

**Rationale (2–4 sentences max):**

If FAIL, specify:  
 ☐ acceleration collapses  
 ☐ negative pressure disappears  
 ☐ behavior reduces to radiation-like dilution  
 ☐ other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

## **4\. Diagnostic D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability**

**Question:**  
 Do physically relevant observables remain invariant under admissible coarse-graining variation?

**Variations applied:**  
 ☐ Horizon placement  
 ☐ Coarse-graining scale  
 ☐ Near-boundary DOF reassignment

**Result:**  
 ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL ☐ NOT APPLICABLE

**Failure mode (if FAIL):**  
 ☐ privileged coarse-graining  
 ☐ order-unity change in w+1w+1w+1  
 ☐ acceleration lost  
 ☐ exchange terms become dominant

**Rationale:**

---

## **5\. Diagnostic D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance**

**Question:**  
 Are exchange terms derived from legitimate partition evolution rather than inserted phenomenologically?

**Exchange terms present:**  
 ☐ Yes ☐ No

If Yes:

* Source traced to:  
   ☐ partition evolution  
   ☐ microphysics  
   ☐ phenomenological closure

**Result:**  
 ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL ☐ NOT APPLICABLE

**Rationale:**

---

## **6\. Diagnostic D4 — Mechanism Audit**

**Question:**  
 Does the model introduce genuine new dynamical structure, or does it repackage known inflationary control variables?

**Findings:**  
 ☐ Explicit new DOF drive acceleration  
 ☐ Effective reparameterization only  
 ☐ Inflation-equivalent control variable identified  
 ☐ Mechanism collapses under reexpression

**Result:**  
 ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL

**Rationale:**

---

## **7\. Diagnostic Verdict**

**Final Classification (choose one):**

☐ **Mechanism**  
 ☐ **Reinterpretation**  
 ☐ **Inflation in Disguise**  
 ☐ **Structurally Unstable**  
 ☐ **Underspecified / Ambiguous**

**Primary failure (if any):**

(D1 / D2 / D3 / D4)

**Secondary flags (optional):**

(e.g. descriptive tuning, privileged slicing)

---

## **8\. Binding Notes**

* This verdict applies **only to the declared regime**

* Null results constrain all downstream interpretation

* No reinterpretation beyond the Model Declaration is permitted

---

### **CEDA Enforcement Rule**

This report is final for this run.  
 A new verdict requires a **new declaration**, not a reinterpretation.
