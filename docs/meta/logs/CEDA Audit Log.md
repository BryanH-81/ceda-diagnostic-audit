\*Inflation without Inflaton(s)\* — hep-th/0610054

\*\*Audit Type:\*\* External paper audit    
\*\*Primary Diagnostic:\*\* D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance    
\*\*Secondary Flags:\*\* F-05 — Inflation in Disguise

\#\#\# Summary

This audit examined the proposal that inflationary expansion and reheating can be  
achieved without fundamental scalar fields via a “cascading universe” of vacuum-energy  
transitions.

The analysis finds that the model introduces an explicit vacuum → radiation exchange  
term governed by a decay rate Γ. This parameter controls the duration of accelerated  
expansion, exit conditions, reheating temperature, and perturbation behavior. The  
exchange term is not derived from horizon structure, accessibility constraints, or  
coarse-graining instability, but is instead specified phenomenologically.

\#\#\# CEDA Classification

\- \*\*D3 — Exchange-Term Injection:\*\* FAIL    
  A non-derived Q-term is inserted to drive acceleration and reheating.

\- \*\*F-05 — Inflation in Disguise:\*\* FLAGGED    
  Under reparameterization, Γ plays the functional role of an inflaton potential slope.

\#\#\# Notes

\- Conservation laws are respected throughout.  
\- No horizon agency or entropy-as-driver violations are present.  
\- The failure is structural, not technical.

This audit serves as a canonical example of how conservation-honest models can still  
reintroduce inflationary dynamics under alternative labels.
