# Example Audit — WF1.2 Horizon Reconfiguration Null Control

## Proposal ID

Internal test case WF1.2  
(Constructed to evaluate horizon-mediated accessibility reconfiguration
without additional dynamical structure.)

---

## Run Validity Gate

**Status:** PASS  
All degrees of freedom, partitions, and conservation assumptions explicitly declared.

---

## Diagnostic Results

### D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test

**Outcome:** FAIL

**Evidence:**

- No new dynamical DOF introduced.
- Negative pressure appears only after repartitioning accessible modes.
- Horizon definition directly alters effective stress–energy attribution.

**Failure Signature(s):**

- Horizon treated as causal agent
- Bookkeeping reclassification substitutes for dynamics

---

### D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability

**Outcome:** FAIL

**Evidence:**

- Inflation-like behavior depends on a specific horizon-scale coarse-graining.
- Varying the smoothing scale removes the effect.

---

## Verdict

**Category:** FAIL (Descriptive Mechanism)

The proposal does not generate accelerated expansion through physical dynamics.
All inflation-like behavior arises from horizon-mediated reclassification
of degrees of freedom. Under conservation-honest accounting, the mechanism
reduces to bookkeeping.

---

## Required Fix (Non-Rescuable)

To pass D1/D2, the proposal would need to introduce
explicit dynamical structure capable of sourcing negative pressure
independently of horizon redefinition.

Retrospective reinterpretation is not admissible.
