# CEDA Overview
Purpose: Provide a standardized diagnostic audit to distinguish physical mechanism from descriptive bookkeeping.

Scope: Early-universe proposals, inflation-adjacent reinterpretations, horizon/coarse-graining arguments, effective stress–energy constructions.

Non-claims: CEDA does not propose a new mechanism; it audits proposed mechanisms.
