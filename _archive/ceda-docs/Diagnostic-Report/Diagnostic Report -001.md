\*\*Audit ID:\*\* CEDA-Audit-001

\*\*Title:\*\* \*Inflation without Inflaton(s)\*

\#\# Run Validity Gate

\*\*Status:\*\* PASS

\- The proposal clearly states its degrees of freedom.  
\- Conservation laws are respected at the equation level.  
\- The exchange mechanism is explicitly declared.

The model is eligible for full diagnostic evaluation.

\#\# Diagnostic Results

\#\#\# D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test

\*\*Result:\*\* PASS (Not Applicable)

The proposal does not attribute accelerated expansion to horizon  
repartitioning, accessibility changes, or entropy bookkeeping.  
Horizons play no causal role in the mechanism.

\---

\#\#\# D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability

\*\*Result:\*\* PASS (Trivial)

No inflationary behavior is claimed to emerge from coarse-graining,  
averaging, or scale-dependent description changes.  
Dynamics are parameter-controlled rather than coarse-graining-driven.

\---

\#\#\# D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance

\*\*Result:\*\* \*\*FAIL\*\*

The inflationary phase and reheating depend on an explicit exchange term:

\\\[  
Q\_\\Lambda \= \-\\Gamma \\rho\_\\Lambda, \\quad  
Q\_r \= \+\\Gamma \\rho\_\\Lambda  
\\\]

The decay rate \\( \\Gamma \\) is not derived from:  
\- horizon structure,  
\- accessibility constraints,  
\- geometric instabilities,  
\- or microphysical dynamics specified within the model.

Instead, \\( \\Gamma \\) is introduced phenomenologically to regulate the duration  
of acceleration and the exit into radiation domination.

Under CEDA, this constitutes \*\*Exchange-Term Injection\*\*.

\---

\#\#\# D4 — Mechanism Audit (Inflation Equivalence)

\*\*Result:\*\* FLAGGED

Although no scalar inflaton field is present, the decay rate \\( \\Gamma \\)  
plays the functional role of an inflaton potential slope:

\- tuning \\( \\Gamma \\ll H \\) yields sustained inflation,  
\- increasing \\( \\Gamma \\) terminates inflation and reheats the universe.

Under reparameterization, the mechanism is dynamically equivalent to  
vacuum-decay or chain-inflation–type models.

\---

\#\# Final Verdict

\*\*CEDA Classification:\*\*    
\*\*D3 Failure — Exchange-Term Injection\*\*    
\*\*Secondary Flag:\*\* F-05 (Inflation in Disguise)

The proposal is conservation-honest and technically consistent, but its  
inflationary behavior depends on hidden dynamical structure introduced via  
a non-derived decay parameter.

The absence of a scalar field does not eliminate inflationary dynamics;  
it relocates them into an explicit vacuum decay channel.

\---

\#\# Notes

\- This is a \*\*structural diagnostic\*\*, not a refutation.  
\- The failure is principled, not technical.  
\- The model serves as a canonical example of how inflationary dynamics  
  persist under alternative labeling when conservation is enforced.
