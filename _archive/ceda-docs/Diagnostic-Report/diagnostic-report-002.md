\#\# Run Validity Gate

\*\*Status:\*\* PASS

\- Degrees of freedom are explicitly stated.  
\- No hidden exchange terms are introduced.  
\- Conservation laws are asserted at the equation level.

\#\# Diagnostic Results

\#\#\# D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test

\*\*Result:\*\* PENDING

Key question: does accelerated expansion persist if the horizon is treated  
strictly as a descriptive boundary with no causal agency?

\---

\#\#\# D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability

\*\*Result:\*\* PENDING

Assessment will determine whether the acceleration depends on privileged  
coarse-graining at the horizon scale.

\---

\#\#\# D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance

\*\*Result:\*\* PASS (No explicit exchange terms)

No decay rates or energy transfer terms are introduced.

\---

\#\#\# D4 — Mechanism Audit

\*\*Result:\*\* PENDING

Assessment will determine whether the proposal reduces to an effective  
equation-of-state reparameterization.
