\# CEDA Model Card

This document records the \*declared structure\* of a proposed early-universe model prior to any diagnostics.  
All entries must be explicit. Ambiguity defaults to failure of the Run Validity Gate.

\---

\#\# 0\. Proposal Identification

\- \*\*Title:\*\*  
\- \*\*Authors:\*\*  
\- \*\*Year / Venue (arXiv / journal):\*\*  
\- \*\*Link:\*\*

\---

\#\# 1\. Claimed Mechanism (Concise)

In 1–3 sentences, state exactly what is claimed to \*cause\* accelerated expansion, smoothing, or inflation-like behavior.

\> Avoid interpretive language. State the mechanism as the authors intend it to function physically.

\---

\#\# 2\. Degrees of Freedom (DOF)

\#\#\# Explicit Dynamical DOF  
List all fields, modes, or variables that enter the action or equations of motion as dynamical entities.

\#\#\# Effective / Collective DOF  
List any coarse-grained, emergent, or averaged quantities treated as contributors to stress–energy or dynamics.

\#\#\# Fixed / Constrained Quantities  
List quantities that are assumed fixed, frozen, or externally specified.

\---

\#\# 3\. System–Environment Partition

\- \*\*System (interior degrees of freedom):\*\*  
\- \*\*Environment (exterior / traced-out / inaccessible degrees of freedom):\*\*  
\- \*\*Boundary definition (horizon, cutoff, causal surface, etc.):\*\*

State whether the partition evolves in time and, if so, how.

\---

\#\# 4\. Conservation Accounting

\- \*\*Stress–energy tensor used:\*\*  
\- \*\*Any effective or additional terms introduced:\*\*  
\- \*\*Where conservation is enforced (equations / identities):\*\*

If conservation is claimed only “effectively” or “on average,” state this explicitly.

\---

\#\# 5\. Horizon Use (if applicable)

\- \*\*Horizon definition:\*\*  
\- \*\*Role in the argument (bookkeeping, dynamics, constraint):\*\*  
\- \*\*What quantities depend explicitly on the horizon choice:\*\*

If the horizon is claimed to be non-dynamical, state how it nonetheless affects the model.

\---

\#\# 6\. Coarse-Graining Prescription

\- \*\*Smoothing scale(s):\*\*  
\- \*\*Justification for choice:\*\*  
\- \*\*Range of admissible variations to be tested:\*\*

If no admissible variation is specified, this will be flagged in D2.

\---

\#\# 7\. Location of Negative Pressure / Acceleration

Identify \*where\* the negative pressure or inflationary behavior physically resides.

\- \*\*Equation number(s):\*\*  
\- \*\*Term(s) responsible:\*\*  
\- \*\*Physical source (DOF, constraint, geometry, boundary condition):\*\*

“Emerges from interpretation” is not an acceptable answer.

\- \[ \] D1 — Horizon Reconfiguration Null Test    
\- \[ \] D2 — Coarse-Graining Stability    
\- \[ \] D3 — Exchange-Term Provenance    
\- \[ \] D4 — Mechanism Audit

\#\# 9\. Known Fragilities / Author Caveats

List any limitations, fine-tuning statements, or caveats acknowledged by the authors.
